**You should say:**

1. what it is

3. how you learned to use it

5. how long you have had it

Sometimes, I think that if this particular electronic equipment were invented during the middle ages or little later, it surely would have been considered as one of the 7th wonders of the old world by replacing one of the existing ones. Today, I would like to talk about a piece of wonderful electronic equipment which I think deserves a lot more credit than we are ready to give.

This electronic equipment is called the mighty “vacuum cleaner”. Of course, we might not just call it “mighty” because we are probably too much used to working with it, but if we can just manage our world for a week without a vacuum cleaner, I am sure that we would gladly change your mind about putting the word “mighty” before a vacuum cleaner.

Anyway, so what is exactly so special about a vacuum cleaner? Well, we can answer this question by simply saying that this incredible equipment helps me clean my home and office, and all other places between them, and put them in order through the mechanism of an air pump and a suction device inside it. Now, even though, we have this equipment at our home since the time I can remember about things, but I didn’t really learn to use it until after I had started high school. Of course, for that, I will have to thank my elder sister since it was her who taught me how to switch it on and manoeuvre it on the floor and carpet to suck the dirt off them. By the way, unlike other vacuum cleaners, the one we have at home is lightweight and rather easy to operate on all kinds of surfaces.

Anyway, I find this electronic equipment really useful, mainly because it helps me and my family keep our home dirt-free and clean without using too much of our efforts and time. The equipment is useful also because it helps us save a significant amount of money since we don’t have to hire any cleaning person to clean our home.
