**You should say:**

- **what the situation was**

- **where you were who you communicated with**

- **and explain why you used a foreign language to communicate on this occasion**

I have been learning English for a long time, but I haven’t had many chances to practice speaking English with native speakers. To the best of my recollection, the first time I used it was on Christmas Eve three years ago.

At that time, I was hanging out with my friends. Suddenly, a foreigner came up to me and asked for directions to a supermarket. Honestly, he spoke too quickly for me to catch everything. But after he repeated his words, I finally understood and showed him the way to the nearest supermarket.

I used body language a lot to explain the directions to him, since I didn’t speak English well then. After that, he said “Thank you” to me and headed for the supermarket. I realize that English plays an important role in our life, despite the fact that we don’t live in English-speaking countries. It is spoken globally and it’s becoming the dominant language. Therefore, I have been trying to practice speaking English daily, so that I can have a good command over the language, and I can confidently hold conversations with foreigners, no matter the topic of conversation.
