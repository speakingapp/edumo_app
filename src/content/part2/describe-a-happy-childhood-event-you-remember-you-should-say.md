When I was a child, I experienced a notable number of events but not all of them were happy. I also cannot remember all of them clearly. But I will always remember the event of receiving a large birthday present. It was a remote-controlled car that I had long been desiring for. My father presented me with the gift and it was a surprise for me indeed. I was too happy with the gift that I played with the car for the remaining parts of the day. Even I forgot to take my regular meals too. In fact, it was the best present ever I received in my life and also makes me remember of my childhood. On that day, I was taking preparations from the early part of the day to celebrate the event. Guests started to arrive in the evening. But the number of guests were limited. Only the family members, some intimate relatives and some of the business partners of my dad. But the number of invited guests crossed 20 and it was difficult to manage everything, particularly the entertainment issue of the guests. However, my dad managed everything. The invited guests also brought gifts for me marking the fifth birthday of mine.

To be frank, I was overjoyed with the matter. I was amazed at the gifts and the people present there also greeted me in various ways. The decision to celebrate my birthday was taken a couple of days ago, and I was joyed hearing the news. Since I was a small kid, I did not know actually the meaning of celebrating a birthday but enjoyed blowing the candles and cutting the cake. My parents had been celebrating the day from my early age but once I crossed my teenage, I actually find no interest in such activities. The feelings in my childhood were really great about the issue. I can remember this particular event as I received the most impressive gift of my life. I have celebrated many of my birthdays but that one was the best. I was greatly happy with the people and presents. To be honest, I had never received such great gifts after that birthday celebration. Besides, I enjoyed the company of other people and the foods were delicious. I still can remember the day when my parents fed me the birthday cake and everyone clapped around us.

It was the most special day of my life. Not only the gifts, I was blessed by everyone present at the event. In fact, it was the best ever birthday celebration of my life. So, it is still vivid in my memory.
