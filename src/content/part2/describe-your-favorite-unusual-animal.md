**You should say:**Â 

- what animal it is

- where you saw it

- what it looks like

**and explain why you think it is an interesting animal.**

Animals are one of the most fascinating and diverse creations of nature. There are so many different types of animals that exist on our planet. Among them, the animal which I find the most interesting is the "chameleon". For this topic, I would like to talk about this animal that I personally find so fascinating and interesting. The chameleon is a type of lizard that is known for its ability to change colour. This unique ability of the chameleon has always amazed me.

I first saw a chameleon at the zoo in my hometown. It was a small green and brown chameleon that was sitting on a branch. The chameleon was trying to blend in with the branch by changing its colour to match the surroundings. Later, I have seen this interesting creature a few times in different places including at a friend's house.

Chameleons have a distinctive appearance. They have a long and slender body with a small head and eyes that move independently. Their feet are specially adapted for climbing and grasping. Chameleons have a long, sticky tongue that they use to catch insects.

Another interesting fact about chameleons is that they have the ability to move their eyes independently. This allows them to look in two different directions at the same time. This is particularly useful when hunting for prey or trying to avoid predators
