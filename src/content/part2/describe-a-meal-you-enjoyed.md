I went to visit (…say a city or country name here…) last year and stayed there for about 25 days. I travelled there for some professional reason and stayed at three different hotels during my stay there. There I enjoyed a meal to a great extent, and for this topic, I would like to talk about this meal and my experience of it.

The food habits of people in this city/ country were very much different than what I usually eat in our city/country. Since I had to stay there for a while, it was a bit difficult for me to enjoy all the meals I was eating. Not that I disliked all the foods I ate there, but the food that was easily available around me was something I ate but did not enjoy much.

After a few days, I went to visit one of my relatives on a weekend there. To my surprise, they prepared one of my favourite meals. It is a signature meal in our city/country. That was a surprise and I was so overwhelmed with joy to see that they have prepared the meal with such care and affection. The four family members and I ate together and I ate voraciously as I enjoyed the taste and flavour of every single food item they had served.

I ate dinner at this relative’s house. I ate (…say some of your favourite food items' names here…) and I enjoyed the way those food items were cooked and served. It was like eating a beloved food after a really long time. I was a bit ashamed that I ate a bit more food than I usually do at dinner time.

I enjoyed the meal because they were so delicious and I ate them after a while. They were also some of my favourite menus from my city/country. So when I ate some of my favourite foods all of a sudden, in a land far away from my home, I got a bit nostalgic! Moreover, my relative and her husband had been very cordial and I enjoyed their company and the way they served me the dish. Overall, it was a great meal with some really lovely and happy people.
