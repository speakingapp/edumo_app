**You should say:**

- what it is and why you read it

- what are the benefits of reading a newspaper or a magazine

- how often you read it and what types of reports it contains

**and explain why do you like to read this newspaper or magazine.**

The history of the newspaper goes back to the 17th century when arguably the very first newspaper called “The Oxford Gazette” was ever printed in its current format in 1665. Since then, centuries have passed, and many earth-shattering events have taken place to change the world, but the appeal of newspapers hasn’t diminished. In fact, they have actually gained more popularity among their readers with their “online edition”, such as “BBC online news”, which I am about to talk now.

I read BBC online news at least once a day as it contains pretty much all kinds of news from all over the world. Whether we are talking about the latest fashion trends and style or some of the oldest handicraft items in some unknown part of the world, BBC online news has it all. The news portal doesn’t shy away from talking about controversial political, cultural, spiritual, social and economic issues either which are shaping up our world and opinion on a continuous basis one way or another. It also publishes news on all kinds of sports and international travel activities in as much details as possible. One of the main benefits of reading BBC online is that it gets updated every hour, if not every minute, to bring us the latest news. Besides, we don’t really have to pay any extra money to read them except only the charge for using the internet. Another benefit of reading an online newspaper is that they are more “interactive” as they let their readers publish their views online without any major delay.  

Anyway, I like to read BBC online news mainly because it is widely “trusted” all over the world. In fact, it goes to great length to display pictures and videos of news subjects and events in order to prove their authenticity, which may not be found in some other newspapers. Besides, I also like the fact that it has two editions of the website: a UK edition, which gives prominence to UK stories, and an international edition, which prioritises international news for its international readers like me.
