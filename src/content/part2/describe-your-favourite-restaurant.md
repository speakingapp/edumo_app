Mistral is a restaurant located in Ibn Battuta Gate in Dubai and this is one of the finest places for dining in the country. The restaurant is located on the side of a busy marketplace and always is crowded by the visitors from home and abroad. The restaurant staffs are welcoming all the visitors and guests cordially. The entire atmosphere is filled with the smells of spices which are alluring for all. People could have their breakfast, lunch, brunch or dinner and the meals are prepared with the local cuisine of Arabia. Besides, the restaurant also allows the visitors to taste the fresh foods from the seafood fare.

The restaurant looks like a mini marketplace beside a large market for its crowd inside the big place. The place inside is a bit dark yet, the restaurant is preferred by almost all types of visitors here only for the delicious foods and drinks. The seating arrangements are admirable while the serving techniques are also praiseworthy.

The all-day dining station is filled with extraordinary foods and fruits. The seafood collection is adorable while the meats are cooked very well that they almost melt in the mouth. The desserts made in the restaurant is considered as the best one in the country. Moreover, the children section is also wonderful and enriched with attractive toys and attentive staff.

This is a special restaurant to me for some special reasons. I like the seafood and drinks here most and they are really praiseworthy. Often I take my buffet seafood dinner here and the price is also reasonable for me. When I am with my kids, I allow them to play inside the childrenâ€™s room and I do not need to worry about them at all.
