"The Creation of Adam" painted by Michelangelo is the painting that I would like to have in my house. It is a painting that forms the part of the Sistine Chapel Ceiling, and it illustrates the Biblical creation narration of humans from the book of Genesis. This picture depicts the creation of "human" where God breathes life into Adam. This is considered to be one of the finest works ever done by a painter and only rivalled by two other great paintings: Mona Lisa and The Last Supper. I saw a picture of this painting in our history book when I was in high school, and I was amazed by the painting and the idea of the painting. I am sure this painting is priceless, and no individual would be able to own it and hang it in his/her house. But I can buy a copied version of this painting which would cost me around $40. When I looked at the painting in my early childhood, I was enthralled by the idea and fine work of this painting. This painting inspired me to learn more about painting and the greatest work of mythological paintings. Later I learned about other great paintings by Michelangelo and by other greatest artists. Furthermore, every time I look at this picture, I feel the overwhelming joy of creation, the human race and divinity. Because of this, I would like to have this picture (more accurately the copy of the original one) in my home.
