**You should say:**

_1\. Where you took it  
2\. When you took the photo  
3\. How you took it  
4\. And explain how you felt about the photo._

  
A picture is worth a thousand memories because one glance at an image can bring back thousands of stories and memories that one might have otherwise forgotten about. In addition, photographs remind of excellent experiences that one might have had in that specific period of time. Here, I’d like to talk about a photo of myself which I really admire.

A couple of months back in autumn, I completed one of my wishes to travel to Leh-Ladakh by Royal Enfield. The road trip was such an exhilarating experience, with routes covered in barren mountain slopes, rocky terrains, snow-clad peaks, and other picturesque views, which urged me to click pictures on every turn. So, around three in the afternoon, when the sun was candescent, I reached the top of Khardung La. I saw many other bikers clicking panoramic pictures with the snow-clad mountains as the backdrop. Being an avid photographer, I couldn’t resist myself, so I parked my bike aside and eventually grabbed my tripod and iPhone 12 Pro Max to click the best aesthetic landscape pictures.

With remarkable features like time rewind, wide-angle lens, image stabilizer, dual-LED, HDR, and low light photo mode, I captured some exceptional pictures and selfies. Apart from that, a professional photographer clicked the shots of travellers upon registration, so I registered. Surprisingly, my turn came in at around 5 in the evening when the sun was slowly moving towards the west to set. I insisted on the photographer clicking the photographs since I didn’t want to miss the sunset as the backdrop in my portrait, which came out perfectly well.

Now, when I look at the collection of incredible photos, it brings a broad smile to my face and makes me ponder the old saying, which says that there’s beauty everywhere, and all we need to do is look around and capture it in its true essence.
