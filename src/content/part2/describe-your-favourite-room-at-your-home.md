3. _**Which is your favourite room in the house?**_

5. _**Why do you regard it as your favourite?**_

7. _**What changes do you want to make it?**_

Well, rooms are an integral part of our life, and most individuals spend their quality time in the house along with family members. I think it could be a most crucial part for everyone and here I would like to talk about a room which is my favourite and interesting due to an abundance of reasons first of all my favourite room is my own living room because this room is already decorated with precious elements according to modern style. I also remember that time, while manufacturing the whole house, I gave a piece of advice about using Italian marble for my house because I wanted to decorate that house with my own taste and texture. Apart from that ambience of the inside room is quite mesmerising because I always spend my quality time with family members every evening. We also do a lot of extracurricular activities in this room, and one of the things my favourite is the walls of the living room is a marvel because the colour of a wall painted blue-collar along with premium wallpapers always gives a kind electrifying experience whenever he curtains of this living room is specially designed by a Japanese designer that is my favourite part and and and every time my friends and guest alike to visit my house mt first preference to show that room which I found marvellous and feel proud when they stalk the whole the rooms with the naked eye. Furthermore, it looks like a five-star hotel room with all crucial amenities. Whereas. The [furniture](https://ieltsfever.org/describe-a-piece-or-a-set-of-furniture-you-have-seen-or-you-use/) used in the living room is quite expensive and imported, and when I feel more stressed, I would like to spend that time in this room, and I charged up it a few times some time; I often listen to songs on 55INCH led connected with home theatre. Last but not least every evening we also have a cup of coffee and watch the TV and also make some jokes. I feel overwhelmed and on cloud 9 when I visit this room in the day to day life.
