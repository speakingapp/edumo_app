Books play an essential role in every student’s/ person’s life because books providing knowledge of the outside world, introduce them to a world of imagination, improving their reading, writing and speaking skills, and boosting memory and intelligence. I like to read motivational, story and investigation related books.

Today, I would like to talk about a crime and investigation related book. The book name is **"Crime and Punishment"**. It is a novel written by the Russian author Fyodor Dostoevsky. It was first published in the literary journal The Russian Messenger in twelve monthly instalments during 1866. It is a murder storybook that is told from a murder’s point of view.

People did work and study from home. Due to the pandemic, everyone stayed at home last year. At that time, I had much free time, so to utilize the free time, I started to read a different kinds of books. As I said earlier, I like investigation and crime-related books, so I downloaded some books online, and crime and punishment were one of these books.

Book explain a murder’s point of view, behaviour, emotions before and after the murder. The novel’s first masterpiece is a psychological analysis of a person, who thinks that he is an extraordinary/ very unusual person able to take on the spiritual(relating to soul or human spirit as opposed to material or physical things) responsibility of using evil means to achieve.

I am keen to know different types of behaviour, and this book helped me to let know the unique feeling and emotions of murder, so that’s why I think it is an exciting book.
