3. how you travelled

5. why you went on the journey

**and explain why you remember this journey well.**

A journey is always pleasant to me. It not only gives us entertainment, it is helpful to teach over different unknown issues as well. The most important benefit of travelling is the excellent opportunity to gather knowledge. The knowledge earned in first hand experienced cannot be found on books or any other place. So, people like to travel and it a trend for a long past. But sometimes the journeys are not pleasant and the travellers have to undergo different unexpected situation during the trips.

Recently I have made a train journey and it was the most thrilling event in my life as I have never ridden on trains before. I went to join at the marriage ceremony of one of my intimate friends who has passed his childhood days with me. The area where the friend is getting married is at the farthest part of the country and requires trains to reach there.

Fourteen of our childhood friends planned to reach the village marking the marriage and accordingly we bought fourteen train tickets for the purpose. My friends and his family members had started for the village earlier before our journey. On the planned night of the journey, we got out of home reached the railway station to catch the train. But interestingly the train was half an hour late due to an accident on its way to the railway station. We all rode the train and finally, the journey at night on a train begins.

It was the most thrilling experience in my life I have ever made so far. It was highly enjoyable to me due to the nature of the journey. I used to hear experiences of people attentively when they described their experiences about the train journeys but could not ride on a train due to different reasons. So, when the other childhood mates made the plan, I was the only one of them who jumped out of joy.

The journey is truly substantial one for me. It was a moonlit night when the train started and my seat was just beside the window. I looked at the full moon and it appeared that I am floating on the heaven with a great speed. The trees were passing us fast and the illuminated distant localities appeared like stars to me, shining on the large sky. The deep emotions that I felt on the night journey are inexpressible.
