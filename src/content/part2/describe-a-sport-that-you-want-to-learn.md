**You should say:**

1. what sport it is

3. how you plan to learn it

5. how difficult you think it would be to learn

 **and explain why you would like to learn to play this sport.** 

Thank you for this great topic and the opportunity to let me talk about a sport that I would like to learn to play.

Well, I love to take part in different indoor sports and games, and I am considering learning "table tennis" soon. It is an excellent sport, and it requires a set of skills to play well. In my view, table tennis is an exciting sport, and it is a good way of doing daily exercise as an extensive amount of movement is required to play it.

I am planning to learn it at the university where I am currently studying. In fact, our university has a nice arrangement to learn and play table tennis. A good number of students take part in it every day, and among them, I have some of my classmates as well. They have assured me that they would spare some time each day to teach me how to play it, and offer me some tips on how to play well and win the game. I am actually counting on them. Besides, I am planning to watch some YouTube video tutorials on how to play table tennis properly.  
  
I believe learning the basics to play table tennis would not be much difficult for me. But I am also convinced that playing like a professional is quite tough as it requires dedication, a lot of practice, and skills. For now, I would be happy to be able to compete with my classmates and that would be moderately tough, I guess. I think I will need at least six months' practice and commitment to reach that level.

I would like to learn to play table tennis primarily because it is a popular sport among my friends and classmates. As it requires extensive movements and physical exertions, it is also a good way of completing daily exercise which I need urgently as I am gaining some extra pounds. Finally, I would enjoy playing this sport for sure and I would love to become good at it.
