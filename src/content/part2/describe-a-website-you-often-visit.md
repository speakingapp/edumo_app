4\. and explain why you think this website is useful._

  
This is the age of technology. The Internet is one of the important aspects of technology and websites are the entrance to the vast virtual world. I have visited **YouTube**

Basically, YouTube is a video sharing website and mostly the users upload different types of videos on this sharing website. This California based website, YouTube, is available across the world. The website visitors could share a good variety of videos, watch video songs, view movie trailers, dramas, serials and sometimes movies, educational videos and more other entertaining video clips for free of cost. They do not need to pay any charge for using the website. After its inception in 2005, the tech-giant Google bought it in 2006 with over 1.50 billion US dollars. The users are able to upload, share, comment, and rate the videos on the website. Currently, the website is also used for video blogging. Though many of the video clips are uploaded by private initiatives, many of the organisations also use this website for their video contents.

I visit the website frequently in a day and in fact, there are no exact statistics of this visiting. There are no specific times or schedules to visit the site for me, and I think this is for anyone who is familiar with the website. I usually browse the website from my personal computer when I am at home. I use the official laptop when I need to visit during the office hours and sometimes use my cell phone to browse the site when I am on my way to somewhere. Basically, the website could be browsed from anywhere and I take the advantage. I use all the available platforms to browse the website and get my tasks done (mostly enjoying songs).

YouTube offers a wide range of services and mostly those are related to videos. For instance, you sing very well but you do not have familiarity or audience. Okay. You may shoot a video with your cell phone camera and upload the video clip on YouTube. If the video does not violate the YouTube standard, the authority will publish the video on the website is perfect, it would be watched, enjoyed and shared by millions of people which will bring you fame. Besides, one can download the necessary and available videos if needed. All the videos on YouTube are free of cost and there are no hidden charges as well to enjoy the videos. It mostly gains profits from advertisements on the site. Since the number of visitors is more, the advertisers pay the YouTube authority to promote their respective products.

This is a very useful website for several reasons. The most important thing is the cost-free feature. We are in need of some information and videos in our everyday life and if we had to buy all the information, it would be impossible for us. But here we are having the information only by browsing the website. Besides, this is a unique platform to share and enjoy video clips. One can have almost all types of videos including entertaining or educative. People mostly use the website to enjoy the latest video songs, know about the latest movie trailers, pass their leisure hours by enjoying drama, movies, video songs etc. Most of the times, the video contents are useful to the viewers in many aspects and could be used for different purposes as well. Take a simple example. Someone has captured a real murder scene and has uploaded that on YouTube, consequently the video clip could be used as visual evidence against the murder and arrest the criminals.
