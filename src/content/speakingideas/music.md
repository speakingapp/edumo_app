### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: What kind of music do you listen to?

**Examiner**: Do you play any instruments?

Jamie: No I don’t … I’ve always wished I’d **taken up a musical instrument** … I’d love to be able to play the guitar … but I think I’m a bit **tone deaf** so perhaps I’d find it hard …

**Examiner**: Have you got any hobbies or interests?

### Part 2-style task

Describe a song you like to listen to. You should say

- What the piece of music is called

- How long you have liked it

- When you like to listen to it

and say why you like it so much.

Millie: Well … I’m a little older than most students and when I was young Abba the Swedish **pop group** were very famous … I don’t think it was cool to like them even though they had a **huge following** but I think now people have realised what wonderful songs they wrote … one **piece of music** in particular is called ‘Slipping through my fingers’ … it wasn’t a **massive hit** but I love it … it’s a song for parents and it’s all about how quickly our children grow up … it’s a **slow number** and like a lot of their songs it’s a very **catchy tune** … the two women in Abba had great voices and it’s the kind of music you can also **sing along to** easily … even if you don’t have a great voice … I listen to Abba when I feel like a **sing-song** … and I especially like to listen when I’m doing the housework … it stops me thinking about the hard work …

### Part 3-style questions

Examiner: Is the Internet a good or bad thing for the music industry? Thomas: On the one hand it’s good for marketing new **musical talent** or particular bands but it’s so easy to share and **download tracks** for free I think it is costing the industry a lot of money …

Examiner: Should music be treated as seriously as subjects like maths or sciences at school? Carla: I think it should … I don’t think it should be taught in a boring way … I mean making children **read music** … but I do think they should be encouraged to play instruments and to **play things by ear** perhaps … to keep the lessons fun …

Examiner: Where do people usually enjoy listening to music? Sally: In lots of ways or places … as **background music** when they are doing something else … at concerts when a band **goes on tour** … or in clubs or discos …
