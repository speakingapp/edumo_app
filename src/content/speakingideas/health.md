### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: Have you got a relation you’re particularly fond of? Sinita: Yes … my granddad … he’s 94 years old but generally he’s **as fit as a fiddle** … we’re very close and see each other a lot … whenever he **goes down with a cold** or **is under the weather** I make a point of visiting him …

**Examiner**: Do you do any sport? Jon: Yes … I’m keen on skateboarding … but I haven’t done it for a while … I had a bad fall recently and **pulled a muscle** and had a few **cuts and bruises** … but I’m **on the mend** and hope to be doing it again soon …

**Examiner**: Is there anything you’re particularly afraid of? Davide: The dentist … I hate going to the dentist … I only ever go if I **have a toothache** so it usually means I have to **have a filling** or even **have a tooth out** … I really don’t like it …

### Part 2-style task

Describe a time when you were ill. You should say:

- When this was

- What your symptoms were

- How long the illness lasted

and say how it affected your life at the time.

Pierre: This is a tricky one really as I’m usually quite healthy … I’ve never been seriously ill … like everyone else I sometimes get a few **aches and pains** or **catch a cold** … I can remember a few months ago I had to have time off work with **a heavy cold** … I had the usual symptoms … **a blocked nose** … **sore throat** … it lasted quite a while … about 2 weeks I think though I didn’t have that much time off work … for a few days I remember **feeling poorly** but I was **over the worst of it**after a few days and went back to work … I always find it’s better to be active when you feel ill as it keeps your mind off your symptoms … I think my family get a little fed up with me when I’m ill though … I tend to feel sorry for myself and lie on the sofa all day as if I’**m at death’s door** … but as I said earlier … on this occasion it was nothing serious and didn’t really cause me any problems …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: What costs are involved when you are ill in your country? Anya: Well … people have to pay **prescription charges** which can be quite expensive … but fortunately general healthcare is free … unless you want to **go private** of course and then you can pay a fortune for your treatment …

**Examiner**: In your experience are people too quick to take time off work when they’re ill?

Alicia: Yes .. I’ve got friends who have a day off work if they wake up with a **runny nose** … and in most cases they seem **to make a speedy recovery** after they’ve **phoned in sick** …

**Examiner**: Do women pay more attention to their health than men? Julie: I think so yes … women are more likely to see their **GP** for a **check-up** if they’re concerned about something … men tend to avoid facing up to any health problems they have … my dad always seems to have a very **chesty cough** but refuses to go to **make an appointment** to see the doctor …
