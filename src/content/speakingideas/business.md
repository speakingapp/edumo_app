### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: Do you work or are you a student?

Hati: I **run my own business** actually … I have an online business selling cosmetics … I **set up the business** 5 years ago and I’m really enjoying **working for myself** …

**Examiner**: What is your ideal job?

Kaori: I don’t think I’d enjoy working for a big company … I think I’d like **to go it alone** and be **self-employed** … I’m not sure what area of business it would be but I think I’d enjoy the process of **drawing up a business plan** and seeing if I could be successful …

**Examiner**: Is your town a nice place to live?

Monique: It’s OK … the main problem we have is our local high street … it used to be a busy centre but lots of shops have **gone bust** … it must be very difficult **to make a profit** when you have huge supermarkets in the area and a lot haven’t been able to survive with such **cut-throat competition**…

### **Part 2-style task**

Describe a business you know that you admire. You should say

- What this business is

- What the business sells

- How long you have known about the business

and say why you like it so much.

Magda: Actually I discovered a business very recently that I like so much I’d like to do something similar in the future … it’s a small **niche business** that runs courses in how to cook … especially bread … the owner uses his kitchen for the courses and **went into business with** a local community shop and sells a lot of the bread and cakes they make in the shop … I first got to hear about the business last year … my wife paid for me to do one of the baking courses and I got to know the owner during the training … it’s a **lifestyle business** really … he doesn’t have plans **to take on employees** or expand into new areas … he’s happy **earning a living** doing the thing he loves … I really admire what he does and I’m sure a lot of people would love to do something similar … he **has a web presence** … in fact that’s how we got to find out about his company … and he uses social media **to raise the company profile** … but he’s the only person involved in **running the business** so he’s in complete control of where the business goes … that’s something that must make it really satisfying … as long as he’s managing **to balance the books** and the **cash flow** is healthy I’m sure he must be very pleased with what he has achieved …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: Why do some people decide to set up their own business?

Marion: I suppose it’s the idea of being in control of your own destiny … or of believing in a product or service idea you may have … plus it must be very exciting … **launching products** … **winning contracts** … and seeing your **sales figures** improving must be wonderful …

**Examiner**: What are some of the dangers involved in starting a business?

Hiro: Well … obviously you need to have a good idea … some people say you need to **do** **market research** beforehand so you know what the market wants … if you don’t do this you could **go under** … and if it is a good idea the chances are someone else is doing the same thing so you could end up facing **stiff competition** …

**Examiner**: What are some of things you have to do when running your own business that might not appeal to everyone?

Katy: Personally i don’t like being in debt so **taking out a business loan** wouldn’t suit me at all … and I know a lot of companies do **cold calling** to try and **drum up business** … that’s something I’d hate to do … and **laying people off** if the business gets into trouble … that would be horrible …
