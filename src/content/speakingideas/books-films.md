### Part 1

**Examiner**: Do you like to read books? Marie: Yes … I love reading … I like nothing more than **to be engrossed in** a good book … I regularly **take out** books from the library and usually read them **from cover to cover** in no time … and I can’t go to sleep at night without some good **bedtime reading** …

**Examiner**: How often do you go to the cinema? Jemma: Unfortunately we don’t have a cinema near us so we have to go into the nearest town **to catch the latest movie** … I usually avoid seeing popular **box-office hits** which I’m not always keen on seeing … I prefer **low-budget films** … **sci-fi** especially … and there’s a great cinema I go to that has frequent **showings** of films like these …

**Examiner**: Do you prefer reading books or watching films? Louisa: I’m not really **a big reader** … I find books quite **heavy-going** … so I much prefer to see a film … perhaps it’s the **special effects** or the **soundtrack** … I don’t know … I just prefer a film …

### Part 2-style task

Describe a book you have read or a film you have seen. You should say:

- What this book or film was

- When you read or saw it

- Why you decided to see the film or read the book

and say if you enjoyed it and why.

Pauline I like reading … especially English novels … it’s a great way to improve your vocabulary and there are so many fantastic authors to choose from … one book that **came highly recommended** by my teacher was The Mayor of Casterbridge … I was studying at a school in The UK at the time and she said it would give me a picture of what life was like years ago in the area I was living … well I have to say I absolutely loved it … it was **a real page-turner** … it’s a **historical novel** and **the setting** was a fictional town called Casterbridge … but actually it was **based on** a town near where I was studying called Dorchester … it had such a great **plot** … to cut a long story short **it tells the story of** the downfall of a man called Henchard **the central character** who lives during a period of great social change around the time of the industrial revolution … the reason I enjoyed it so much … apart from the great story … it gave me a picture of what life had been like in the place I was studying at the time … I really **couldn’t put it down** … a fantastic story …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: Is reading as pleasurable in digital format? Alise: Personally I prefer reading a **paperback** or **hardback** … especially if I’m reading **a classic** which I don’t think feels right as an **e-book** … but I can see it can be good for others … my grandmother has an **e-reader** and she loves the way you can enlarge the text …

**Examiner**: Do you think bookshops will survive the digital revolution? Thomas: I think so … at least I hope so … I love **flicking through** books in a bookshop … online shopping is useful … finding out on Amazon if a book you want has **got a good review** … maybe getting one that is difficult to find … but I still love the experience of being in a bookshop …

**Examiner**: Statistics show that visits to the cinema are up despite the availability of DVDs and online downloads. Why do you think this might be? Jamie: I think it’s the whole experience that the cinema offers … going out **to see a film** when it **goes on general release** … and seeing it **on the big screen** is more exciting than **watching the film**at home on TV … especially if it’s **an action movie** … and watching it with others makes it even more special …
