### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: What’s the weather like in your country?

Katie: It’s quite **changeable** really … we have periods of time with **clear blue skies** then all of a sudden we’ll have **torrential rain.**

**Examiner**: Which months have the best weather in your country?

Ernst: Well … I suppose it’s a matter of personal taste really … I like it around the end of October and November … I’m not fond of the **heatwaves** we often get during the summer … it’s not **freezing cold** during these months and we still get lots of **sunny spells.**

**Examiner**: Does it bother you much when it rains?

Junko: It depends … if I **get caught in the rain** and I **get drenched** I don’t like it … but I’m a gardener so **a drop of rain** is good for my plants.

### Part 2-style task

Describe a time when you experienced extreme weather conditions. You should say

- When this was

- Where you were

- What the weather was like

and say how you felt about the experience.

I was studying English in a language school a few years ago … we were in Cornwall in the UK … we’d been enjoying lovely sunny days … **not a cloud in the sky** … when all of a sudden there was **a change in the weather** … we were in town walking around the shops when it started **to pour down** … I’d never seen such **heavy rain** before … within about 10 minutes the roads were full of water … I think they call it a **flash flood** … it was like being in the middle of a **tropical storm** … the water was almost up to my knees … the **weather forecast** hadn’t predicted it so everyone was taken by surprise … I’m not sure you could call it ‘extreme’ weather as a few hours later it started **to clear up** … **the sun came out** and slowly the water level went down … but a lot of people’s houses were flooded so it would have been extreme for them … I found it all quite exciting … in my country we generally have a very **mild climate** and don’t often get floods like this so it was quite an experience for me.

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: Do you think the weather affects how people feel?

Tierre: Absolutely … yes … I don’t mind the occasional **cold spell** but I think the winter months can make you feel down. I hate having to leave the house in the winter … there’s often a **thick fog**every morning and we sometimes get **bitterly** **cold** winds … the winter certainly makes me feel a little depressed … though having said that … it’s always nice to see the town covered in a **blanket of snow.**

**Examiner**: Do you think the weather is changing due to global warming?

Ceri: I don’t know if it’s due to global warming or not but the weather in my country is certainly changing … we’ve been getting quite **mild winters** lately … the temperatures are sometimes **below freezing** but only occasionally … and then during the summer it can get **boiling hot** with a lot of older people even suffering from **heatstroke**.

**Examiner**: In which ways are weather forecasts useful?

Sinita: Well … if you’re planning a trip or going on holiday it’s important to know whether you’ll need to **dress up warm** or take an umbrella … farmers need to know what the **long-range forecast** is so they can plan their work … I suppose people who organise outside events need to know as well in case things get **rained off**.
