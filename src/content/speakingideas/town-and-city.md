### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: What is it like where you live?

Christiane: I live in a **residential area** of a busy town in the south of Spain … we have all the facilities you need … good **public transport** … a good **shopping centre** … it’s nice …

**Examiner**: Do you like living in the city?

Andrea: Yes I do … I like going out with my friends and there are lots of **lively bars and restaurants** within walking distance of my apartment … I’m a bit of a culture vulture as well so it’s great to have access to art exhibitions and that kind of thing …

**Examiner**: Do you get many tourists visiting your area?

Mandy: Not really no … I live in the **inner-city** and the area is a little **run down** … it’s basically a lot of **high-rise flats** and many of the shops are **boarded up** … so nothing to interest tourists really …

### Part 2-style task

Describe an interesting town or city in your country that visitors might enjoy. You should say

- What the place is called

- Where the place is

- What the facilities are like

and say why visitors might enjoy going there.

Monique: Anyone who comes to my country really should spend some time in Barcelona … it’s a beautiful place … it’s not what you would call a **sprawling city** … it’s quite compact really and you could walk across the city in a couple of hours … but there’s no need to do that as we have a fantastic **public transport system** so it’s easy **to get around** … there are various districts all with their own character … you have the **upmarket shops** in the centre … you’ll find lots of **chain stores** you’ll recognise from your own country but also local brands as well … we have the narrow streets in the Gothic district with lots of **fashionable boutiques** and **tourist attractions** … there’s the Olympic area and the beaches along the coast … and dotted around the city are some lovely **public spaces** … parks and squares in the **city centre** and **on the outskirts** of Barcelona where people relax with their friends and family … and of course **pavement cafes** everywhere … all that and some great historical **places of interest** … so a great destination for tourists …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: What are the advantages of living in a city or big town?

Carrie: I think it’s having access to **local facilities** really … local shops as well as access to larger **shopping malls** in the city centre … and if you’re well-off you can afford to live **in the suburbs**away from the busy traffic …

**Examiner**: In your experience are city centres usually attractive places?

Mary: Some can be yes … especially those with a historical interest … but sometimes they’re full of ugly **office blocks** … **multi-story car parks** … and residents living in **poor housing** … it depends on the city doesn’t it?

**Examiner**: What are some of the challenges facing towns and cities?

Penny: I suppose **traffic congestion** is a major problem … and the growth in **out-of-town supermarkets and retail parks** mean lots of town centre shops are **closing down** … plus a shortage of good quality housing … I think these are the major challenges …
