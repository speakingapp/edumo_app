### Part 1

**Examiner**: Are there any TV channels in your country that don’t have adverts?

Loraine: No … they’re all **commercial channels** and **show adverts** all day long … too many really … and there’s also a lot of **product placement** going on … especially in soap operas where they place an item just behind the actors.

**Examiner**: Do you enjoy watching adverts on TV?

Karin: No … not really … I hate **commercial breaks** during a film … it really spoils the flow … and during **prime time** viewing they seem to squeeze even more ads in than usual … **celebrity endorsements** also get on my nerves … everyone knows they’re only doing it because they’re getting paid.

**Examiner**: What are the best ways for ordinary people to advertise something they want to sell in your country?

Marianne: The simplest way is to **place an advert** in something like the **classified ads** section of a local paper … or there’s the Internet of course … there are lots of sites like eBay where you can **buy and sell** things online.

### Part 2-style task

Describe an advert you once saw that was very effective. You should say

- Where this advert appeared

- When you saw it

- What it was advertising

and say why you thought it was so effective.

Max: OK … well this was about 4 years ago … I was looking for some software to create videos … one day I got an email from a **mailing list** I’d signed up to … there was a link in it to a **press release** … a company had written something about a new product that was similar to what I was looking for … at the end of the press release there was a link to the **sales page** … I hadn’t heard of the company but I was interested and clicked the link to the ad …. what caught my attention immediately were the number of testimonials from people who had bought the software … I think testimonials are like the online equivalent of **word of mouth** advertising and are really persuasive … anyway … when I got to the bottom of the page there was a great big **call to action** button inviting me to buy … I was totally persuaded and ended up making a purchase … what made it so effective I think was the power of those testimonials … they’d been written by people very much like me … they’d had a need and the software had obviously turned out to be just what they were looking for … when you think that this was a newish company they wouldn’t have had any **brand awareness** at all … they probably wouldn’t have had much of a budget for advertising … obviously you wouldn’t advertise a product like this through the **mass media** on TV … they probably didn’t even have an **advertising agency** to support them …and yet they’d managed to create a great deal of **brand loyalty** from previous customers … I think that was really effective.

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: What is it that makes an advert effective?

Spencer: Well … when a company **launches a product** they have to consider the Internet … especially how it can be used to spread the word on **social media** … so in this context a video that **goes viral** is probably the most effective type of advert you could make.

**Examiner**: What are the advantages to companies of advertising on the Internet rather than TV?

Stelios: I’d imagine the main advantage is you can reach your **target audience** much more effectively … if you bring out a **niche product** for example … or you have a tight **advertising budget** … you can advertise on particular sites that the people you want to reach visit … that’s not something you can do on TV.

**Examiner**: What things do advertising companies do that might give it a bad name?

Raol: For me the most irritating is **cold calling** … we must get two or three of these every day at work … then there’s **junk mail** that gets posted through the letterbox … and of course the online equivalent of this … **spam emails** … I think it’s this kind of advertising that tends to annoy people.
