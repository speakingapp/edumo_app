### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: Are there any environmental problems in your country?

Kelly: Yes … we have a serious issue with **pollution levels** in some of our big cities … **exhaust fumes** from cars and lorries are definitely one reason for the problem but we also have a lot of **heavy industry** in some areas and this also results in poor **air quality** …

**Examiner**: Do you take an interest in nature?

Jenny: Well … I’m a city person through and through and don’t **get back to nature** very often I’m afraid … but like everyone else I’m fascinated by **the natural world** and I like watching documentaries showing wild animals in their **natural habitat** …

**Examiner**: Do you or your family take steps to help the environment?

Mira: My parents have always tried to make us aware of our **impact on the environment**… they’re really into **energy conservation** … and always try to buy **environmentally friendly**products if they have the chance …

### Part 2-style task

Describe an environmental problem that has been in the news. You should say

- When this was

- Where the event happened

- What actually took place

and say how you felt about this problem.

Martin: Well … this is an interesting question … there are so many issues I could think of … **natural disasters** like earthquakes and floods seem to be in the news almost every year … but there was one story recently about some animals that were **under threat** … it wasn’t focused on one place in particular … it was looking at various animals that could actually **become extinct** in different African countries … if we don’t take steps to protect them … these were really iconic animals like gorillas … leopards … rhinos … and apparently they’re now listed as **endangered species** … what made it really depressing was they were in danger thanks to us … in some cases it was due to a **loss of habitat** either because people need more agricultural production … or even worse I think … because of hunting and **poaching** … I hate to think of **future generations** being robbed of the chance to see creatures like these in their **natural environment** … it’s lucky we have lots of organisations that focus on **wildlife conservation** … hopefully with their help we can put pressure on those in power to do something to stop creatures like these **dying out** …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: What do you think is the main danger the world faces in terms of the environment?

Spencer: Well … **climate change** is a real issue … in my country we have **flash floods** and heatwaves on a yearly basis … so yes … I think **global warming** is the biggest issue.

**Examiner**: What examples are there of how we damage the natural world?

Stella: There are so many examples … there are factories that empty **toxic waste** into rivers and oceans … **oil spills** that damage the coastline … the way we destroy vast areas of land and rain forests in search of **fossil fuels** or to increase agricultural production …

**Examiner**: In which ways do we respond well to environmental problems?

Mathius: Well … on the one hand there are various worldwide agencies that are always the first on the scene with **humanitarian aid** after natural and **man-made disasters** … and on the other hand we have environmental **pressure groups** that are constantly raising awareness of issues and trying to stop disasters happening …
