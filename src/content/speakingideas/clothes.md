### Part 1

**Examiner**: Do you enjoy buying clothes?

Pedro: I used to … yes … like most young people I was a bit of **a slave to fashion** and I’d always have to buy that **must-have** shirt or pair of shoes … I’m not so bothered now though … I wouldn’t feel comfortable wearing something **old fashioned** but I’m not as bothered as I used to be about what I wear …

**Examiner**: What kind of clothes do you like to wear?

Marco: I prefer **casual clothes** actually … I hate **getting dressed up** for special occasions … personally I think it’s possible **to look good in** a pair of jeans … but that’s my opinion … I don’t think my wife would call me a **fashion icon** that’s for sure …

**Examiner**: Are there many clothes shops where you live?

Sylvia: Yes … there are lots in my town … apart from the big chain stores we’ve got a couple of really nice shops that sell **vintage clothes** … old clothes but in a **classic style** that never really **go out of fashion** … I love going there …

### Part 2-style task

Describe someone you know who dresses well. You should say

- Who they are

- How you know them

- What kind of clothes they wear

and say why you like the way they dress.

Tomoko: I’d like to talk about one of my teachers … Miss Evans … she teaches us English in the school I go to … we always look forward to seeing what she’s going to wear when our lessons start … she’s always very **well dressed** and **takes a lot of pride in her appearance** … it’s not that she dresses in very **smart clothes** … she doesn’t come to school **dressed to kill** or anything like that … but what she wears really **suits her** … and she has a great **sense of style** as well … we often ask her where she gets some of her clothes and most of the time they’re just **off the peg** … and she says she’s not interested in **designer labels** or anything like that … she doesn’t seem too concerned about **keeping up with the latest fashion** … she just wears clothes that are **timeless** … yes … Miss Evans is the person I think looks great in the clothes she wears …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: What factors do you think affect the clothes we choose to wear?

Maki: It depends … where we are or where we’re going is a big factor … if you are going out to a club or party you’re going **to dress for the occasion** … and then there are those who think it’s important to look like they’re **on trend** … they’ll want to wear the latest fashions … there are lots of factors really …

**Examiner**: What kind of things determine what is in fashion and what we should be wearing?

Martin: I suppose the big **fashion houses** and **fashion shows** must have an effect but the clothes you see **on the catwalk** don’t always reflect what normal people wear … so I suppose it will be things like what singers are wearing in videos or models are wearing in magazines … that kind of thing …

**Examiner**: Is it possible to look good without spending lots of money on clothes?

Corinna: I’m sure it is … yes … I suppose it’s about **having an eye for** what looks good … knowing how **to mix and match** different items of clothing that go well together … I think you can pick up great bargains in charity shops … sometimes for youngsters even **hand-me-downs** can look good …
