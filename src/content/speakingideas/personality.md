### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: How would you describe yourself?

Paula: Everyone tells me I **take after** my mum as I’m quite **laid-back** … I think I’m **good company**but you should ask my friends if they agree …

**Examiner**: In which ways are you similar to your friends?

Manuel: I seem to be attracted to **introverts** … not people who are **painfully shy** but most of my friends are a little **reserved** … and I think that’s what I’m like…

**Examiner**: Are you similar or different to your brother(s)/sister(s)?

Mira: I think my brother and I are very similar … I’d say we’re **fun-loving** and tend to be a bit **extroverted** … my brother is certainly **the life and soul of the party** … I’m not sure that applies to me …

### Part 2-style task

Describe a teacher you once had who you enjoyed being taught by. You should say

- Who this person was

- When they were your teacher

- Which subject they taught you

and describe what it was about their character that you liked.

Carolina: I’d like to describe my English teacher from school … Miss Thomas … this was a few years ago now and she was my teacher at a time when I was getting a little bored with being at school … unlike some of the other teachers Miss Thomas never **lost her temper** … she was very calm and **easy-going** … she was also very **broad-minded** … we were able to ask her questions about lots of subjects that some other teachers would refuse to discuss which made us respect her even more … she had a great **sense of humour** too … she’d laugh at our jokes as well as making us laugh … and she would also **bend over backwards** to help us with our work … she always **put us first** and often stayed around at the end of class to talk with anyone who needed help … apparently she was highly respected within her field but you would never know as she was the type that **hid her light under a bushel** … she was very modest and **self-effacing** … so yes … Miss Thomas was a teacher I have fond memories of …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: Which personal qualities do you think we most want to pass on to our children?

Martin: I certainly would want my children to be **self-confident** and **self-assured** … I really believe that people who feel good about themselves are in a good position to face what life has to offer them … and I’d hope they wouldn’t be **self-centred** … but remembered to think about others …

**Examiner**: Which characteristics do you think are the least appealing in a person?

Marianne: Well … people who are very **narrow-minded** are difficult to get on with … it’s nice when someone is open to other people’s opinion and willing to think about their own views … and people who are **two-faced** can be a little irritating … relationships are built on trust and without honesty there’s not much left …

**Examiner**: Which personality types do you think are less likely to suffer from stress or anxiety?

Sol: Probably people who are **thick-skinned** … who don’t let people or problems affect them too much … and if you are **fair-minded** you’ ll be less likely to overreact to situations or be **quick-tempered** …
