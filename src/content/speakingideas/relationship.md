**Examiner**: Do you see your friends very often? Louisa: Yes … we meet up most weekends … we all **get on really well** and **have a lot in common** so we’re always happy doing the same things and going to the same places.

**Examiner**: What do you like about your close friends? Anna: I think we **enjoy each other’s company** … we **see eye-to-eye on** most things so we rarely **fall out with** each other.

**Examiner**: Have you known each other long? Amy: Most of them yes … although my closest friend Carrie … we **struck up a relationship** at college and **got on like a house on fire** … but yes … my other friendships **go back years** to when we were at school.

### Part 2-style task

Describe a person you are very close to. You should say:

- Who this person is

- When you met them

- Where you met them

- and say what it is about them you like so much.

Reiko: I’d like to talk about my boyfriend … Jose … we **got to know** each other at University almost 4 years ago … we were in the same department … initially we were **just good friends** and used to go out in a group with our other friends … when Jose went back to Spain for the holidays we would **keep in touch with** each other … then one year he invited me to come to Spain with him … and that’s when we **fell for** each other I think … so you couldn’t really say it was **love at first sight** as it had been over a year since we’d met … but we really **hit it off** and by the time we got back to university in September we were able to tell all our friends that we were **in a relationship**… what do I like about Jose … well he’s very kind … very funny … and very supportive … and we’re really **well matched** in our interests … he hasn’t **popped the question** yet though … we’ve talked about getting married and I think we’re both ready **to settle down** and have children … we’ll just have to wait and see …

### Part 3-style questions

Examiner: Do you think marriage is still as important as ever? Cristine: Yes … it certainly is in my country … I think the problem for some people is a lack of commitment … all relationships **have their ups and downs** …. but some people prefer to **break up**rather than **working at** the relationship.

Examiner: What do you think is the ideal time to get married? Terry: Personally … I think you should wait until you’ve found yourself first … decided if you want a career … perhaps do some travelling … you should do this before **tying the knot** … although if you **fall head over heels in love** plans like these can easily be forgotten.

Examiner: Is it important to keep in contact with our friends when we’re in a relationship? Maria: Absolutely … it’s so easy to **drift apart** from your friends when you **fall in**

**love** … but I think both partners should try not **to lose touch with** their friends … that’s the best way to have a **healthy relationship** with your partner.
