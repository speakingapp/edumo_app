### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: Do you like to cook? Mandy: Not really no … most of the time I eat **ready meals** and **take-aways** … that’s one of the reasons I love visiting my mum … you can always guarantee lovely **home-cooked food** …

**Examiner**: What time do you usually eat dinner? Michelle: We have our **main meal** at around 7.00 … I’m usually **starving hungry** by then … in fact I often **grab a bite to eat** as soon as I get home from college … a sandwich perhaps … but not too much **to spoil my appetite** …

**Examiner**: Are there any types of food you don’t like? Lionel: No not really … I’m not **a fussy eater** at all … actually I **eat like a horse** … I do a lot of sport and **work up quite an appetite** …

### Part 2-style task

Describe a restaurant that you like to use. You should say

- Where this restaurant is

- What kind of food it serves

- How often you go there

and say why you like eating there so much.

Howard: OK … this is a nice topic to talk about … there’s a restaurant just around the corner from where I live … it’s an Italian restaurant so as you’d expect you can eat various pasta dishes and pizzas and I usually go there with my family for **a slap-up meal** if we have anything to celebrate … it’s quite a posh restaurant … the kind of place you would take someone if you wanted **to wine and dine** them … we usually order **a 3-course meal** … a light starter then a main dish … and I have quite **a sweet tooth** so I always look forward to the dessert … I usually order Tiramisu … it **makes my mouth water** just to think about it … I’m always totally **full up** by the end … why do I enjoy it there … well … it’s not cheap … my parents always **foot the bill** and we couldn’t afford to go there regularly so it’s always a nice treat …

### Part 3-style questions

Examiner: How can we encourage people to eat more healthily? Anna: I think the best approach is to have everything in moderation … **processed food** won’t kill you if you only eat it occasionally … but people should also be encouraged **to eat a balanced diet**… try to cook fresh ingredients at home a few times a week …

Examiner: Do you think people enjoy their food as much as they should? Florrie: I don’t know really … I suppose it’s true that people will often eat **a quick snack** because they’re bored not because they’re **dying of hunger** … and often they just **bolt it down** and don’t savour it … so yes … perhaps we could take more time over our food …

Examiner: Do you think cooking is a pleasure or a chore for people who have busy lives? Julie: Well … whether you **follow a recipe** or make something up as you go along … I think cooking is a very creative process … and cooking for other people is a particular pleasure … there’s nothing more satisfying than seeing people you love **tucking into** something you’ve cooked yourself …
