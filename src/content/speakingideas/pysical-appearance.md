### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: Do you look like any other people in your family?

Carlo: No … not at all … take my brother for example … he has short **cropped hair** and has quite a **pointed face** … he’s also quite **fair-skinned** compared to me…

**Examiner**: Tell me about your family.

Andrea: My father’**s getting on a bit** … he’s **in his 60s** … but he **looks very young for his age** … he still does lots of exercise and is quite **well-built** …

**Examiner**: What does your best friend look like?

Mandy: She’s the same age as me … she has **shoulder-length hair** … **fair hair** … she has a **slim figure** and is **medium height** …

### **Part** 2-style **task**

Describe a person whose appearance you like. You should say

- Who this person is

- What their relationship is to you

- What they look like

and say what it is about their appearance you like.

Monique: OK … I’d like to talk about my aunt … her name’s Marta and she’s quite a character … she’**s middle-aged** but has a very **youthful appearance** … she’s a little **overweight** I suppose but not too much … she has a friendly **round face** framed by **thick blonde hair** … she has a lovely **complexion** and she’s always **well-turned out** … she actually always looks like she’s going out for the evening to somewhere special … there’**s never a hair out of place** … I’ve always thought she **bears a striking resemblance to** someone on TV … I can’t remember the name now … she **wears glasses** and always seems to have a different pair on every time I see her … I like the way she looks because she wears clothes that are right for her age and manages to look glamorous without it looking like she’s too done up … yes … I’ll be happy if I look like her when I’m her age …

### **Part 3-style** questions

**Examiner**: Is it important to dress well whenever we go out?

Mark: It depends where you’re going … I know some people **get done up** just to go to the shops … but I don’t see the point … you shouldn’t go out looking **scruffy** with **disheveled hair** but I really don’t see the point in **getting dressed up to the nines** unless you’re going somewhere special …

**Examiner**: Do people worry too much about their appearance as they get older?

Mira: I’m sure they do … yes … but it happens to all of us doesn’t it … we all **go grey** eventually and get **hard of hearing** … we start **to lose our figure** … that’s why plastic surgery is so popular … personally I think we just need **to grow old gracefully** and not worry too much about how we look …

**Examiner**: Is attractiveness a quality worthwhile aiming for?

Phoebe: I’d like to say no … it shouldn’t matter what we look like in terms of our physical appearance … but unfortunately it seems women especially are taken more seriously if they are **good looking** with **a slender figure** with perfect **make up** and so on …
