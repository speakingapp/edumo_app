## Example of speaking part 1 questions

#### What type of technology do you use in your home?

Answer: We have a number of labour-saving devices including state of the art technology in our kitchen. These appliances include an induction stove, a dishwasher, and an Internet-enabled refrigerator. All are connected through the Internet of Things so we can remotely control them.

#### Are you comfortable using modern technology?

Answer: You don't have to be a rocket scientist to use technology today. It\\'s all about booting up, logging in and then clicking on the icon that will take you to your favourite application. On the single occasion that my computer crashed, I called someone in to re-install the programs otherwise I\\'m comfortable.

#### How do you keep your computer and data secure?

Answer: I always shut down the computer at night. I backup my files to a hard drive and I always keep hard copies of important documents. I am very careful with my privacy settings, especially in wireless hotspots.

## Speaking part 2 questions

#### Describe an item of modern technology that is most important to you?

In this type of question, you should describe the type of technology that you use, how long you have been using it, how frequently you use it and how it is a necessary part of your life.

Answer: My laptop is the most important digital appliance in my home. I have had a laptop for years, but I have recently upgraded my computer.

I am computer literate. I study from home and I need Internet access to do my research. Advances in technology have also made it possible for me to work from home. I surf the web in search of freelance opportunities.

In my leisure time, I download books and music from the Internet. I pay for these via Electronic Funds Transfer. I do not condone online piracy, as I value the arts and believe that the authors and songwriters should be rewarded for their work.

I use social media networks to keep up with my friends and family across the globe and I also shop online from time to time.

## Part 3 questions

#### Do you think that there are any disadvantages to modern technology?

Answer: I think that there are several disadvantages. Security can be a problem with people hacking into the Internet. Also, modern technology tends to become rapidly obsolete so we become more and more a throw-away society. People are also losing physical contact with one another as they become glued to their screens.

In what ways do you think people will benefit from technologies in the future?

Answer: Emerging technology has the capacity to change our lives in so many ways. Robots and artificial intelligence are both reducing the amount of tedious work required in a wide range of industries and professions. We can now also get expert advice from across the globe using an internet connection.

In your opinion what are the basic computer skills that every person should have today?

Answer: All the information we require is available on the Internet, so everyone should be able to boot up a computer, log in and know how to use a search engine. Everyone should have access to the Internet so that they can surf the web.
