### Part 2-style task

- When this was

- What is was you bought

- Who you bought it for

and say how you felt about buying it for them.

Coleen: I’d like to tell you about the time … about four years ago … my husband and I bought a computer for our daughter … she was about to go to university and we’d promised her we would treat her to one … at the time there had been a big **advertising campaign** for the latest Apple Macbook and our daughter was very keen to have one … she kept telling us they were **value for money** … even though they seemed very expensive to us … anyway we tried **to shop around** to see if we could **pick up a bargain** … this was in the middle of the **summer sales** and wherever you went **prices were being slashed** on **big brand names** … but unfortunately not Apple products … we ended up having **to pay the full price** … I remember my daughter justifying the cost by pointing out how nice the Apple **carrier bag** was … but it was lovely to see her so excited and the **customer service** she’s received during the four years she’s had it has been excellent … so it was value for money after all …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: Do you think we will stop using paper money in the future?

**Examiner**: How do companies encourage the consumer to spend their money?

Peter: Well … a recent development in my country is something called ‘Black Friday’ where people are encouraged **to shop until they drop** and buy the latest **must-have products** … then there are things like **loyalty cards** to get the customer back in the store …

**Examiner**: What do you think shops need to do to create a positive shopping experience?

Tania: The main thing for me is not being pressurised to buy … I appreciate that shop assistants are probably **on commission** but if I’m looking for clothes for example I like to take my time … **to try something on** … and to ask for help if I need it …
