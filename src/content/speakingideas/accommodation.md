### Part 1-style questions

**Examiner**: Do you live in a house or an apartment?

Callum: Actually I live **on campus** … in a **single room** in **halls of residence** … all first year students are encouraged to do that as they’re close to the university … next year I plan to move into **student digs** in town …

**Examiner**: Tell me about where you live.

Julia: I live with my parents **in the suburbs** of Madrid … we only **moved in** recently … in fact we had a **house-warming party** just a few weeks ago …

**Examiner**: What kind of accommodation do most people live in in your city?

Maria: In the city itself the majority of people live in **apartment blocks** … that’s what surprised me about England … most people seem to live in **terraced houses** with lovely **back gardens** …

### Part 2-style task

Describe a house or an apartment you would like to live in. You should say

- What kind of accommodation it would be

- Where it would be

- Who would live there with you

and say why you would enjoy living in this place.

Paolo: I think most people when answering this question would say they’d like to live in a big **detached house** with **spacious rooms** … views of the countryside and so on … but actually my **ideal home** would be a lot different … I’ve always loved the idea of having a **mobile home** … a really expensive one with **all the mod cons** … so I could live wherever I wanted or at least have lots of holidays and be able to take all my **home comforts** with me whenever I travelled … I realise this would have to be a second home as I’d need a base … a **permanent address** … but the mobile home would be the accommodation I’d find it exciting to live in … I suppose once I settle down and have children I’ll want **to get on the property ladder** … I’ll be like everyone else … saving up **to put down a deposit** on a house or an apartment … I don’t think my family would want to live in a mobile home … but I like to think I’ll still keep that **dream home** in mind …

### Part 3-style questions

**Examiner**: Is it better to own your own home or to rent?

Ana: I think both have their advantages … living in **rented accommodation** isn’t necessarily a bad thing … you don’t have a huge debt like you do when you **take out a mortgage** but I suppose the **property market** offers you an investment for the future … I’m sure that’s why most people prefer **to own their own home** …

**Examiner**: What options are available to young couples looking for accommodation in your country?

Toni: If they want to buy their own home it isn’t easy for **first-time buyers** … mortgages are hard to get so most people live with their parents or in **rented accommodation** … but that can also be very expensive … you often have to **pay** **rent in advance** … and if the accommodation isn’t **fully furnished** you have the expense of buying furniture …

**Examiner**: What are some of the pleasures involved in making a home for ourselves?

Suki: I suppose it starts with **house-hunting** … finding your ideal home … some people enjoy **doing up an old property** … giving a property that’s old and tired a new lease of life … others like making wherever they live feel like home with some **home comforts** …
