#### Examples of IELTS speaking part 1 questions

**Examiner: What food do you like to eat?**

Answer: I am not a fussy eater. As long as you don\\'t feed me rabbit food I\\'m easy to please. My flatmate and I share the cooking chores. Once a week we make a slap-up meal of steak and chips covered in a rich sauce and to satisfy the sweet tooth we finish off with a decadent chocolate pudding.

**Examiner: So, do you enjoy cooking?**

Answer: I prefer eating to cooking. I make good use of ready meals and I am not averse to junk food or the occasional pub lunch. I realize though that it is necessary to include nutritious food in my diet, which is why I cook several times a week.

**Examiner: What is your favourite meal of the day?**

Answer: I'm a breakfast fan. I wake up starving hungry after a good night's sleep. I like nothing better than a good English breakfast of bacon, eggs, and buttery toast, along with a piping hot cup of coffee.

#### IELTS speaking part 2 question

**Examiner: Tell me about your favourite restaurant**

In this question, you should discuss

the restaurant that you like best, why you like it, and the occasions when you go there. Answer: I enjoy fine dining and exotic food. Both are available at my favourite restaurant in the centre of town. On special occasions I take my partner wining and dining. We love the ambience of the candle-lit dinners, and the extensive menu of mouth-watering meals.

The menu includes starters, mains and deserts. Usually by the time we get there I am dying of hunger so we order a starter to calm the hunger pangs. We usually also share a bottle of bubbly. It is after all a celebration. Having finished our starter we take our time, savouring the food.

This is not the type of restaurant where you would ask for a doggy bag, so we waste nothing. We end the evening with a delicious dessert. After settling the bill, we head off home, satisfied that we have enjoyed a scrumptious meal.

#### IELTS speaking part 3 questions

**Examiner: Do you believe that the 21st Century diet is a healthy one?**

Answer: Far too many people are overweight. I believe that people should cut down on sugars and refined carbohydrates and replace them with leafy vegetables and seasonal fruits. A balanced diet would help them to regulate their weight.

**Examiner: Starvation is a problem in many parts of the world. What do you think should be done about it?**

Answer: From what I\\'ve read current global food production can cover the daily consumption needs of the world. We need to find a way to economically transport it to where it is most needed or find alternate food sources. Nobody should starve when there is no shortage of food.

**Examiner: In homes where both parents work do you think cooking has become just another job at the end of the day?**

Answer: I know that food preparation can be time-consuming, but if everyone helps with ideas and recipes and everyone takes a turn and lends a hand, cooking can be fun for the family. Home cooked meals are also often healthier and packed with vitamins.
