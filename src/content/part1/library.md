**Did you go to a library when you were a kid?**

No, I was a TV-era kid, so I grew up watching Cartoon Network and Disney. But I used to read from time to time and it actually was quite a pleasant experience.

**What kind of people would go to a library to read and study?**

Well, it depends on whether the library is a public one or for a specific group, say students. But on the whole, there are a lot of people who like to work, study and just hang out at the library because of its stoic atmosphere.

**Do you often go to the library?**

I’m not a library member, though I used to be during my exam preps. It was a go-to place where I could do my tests and write essays without interruptions.

**Are libraries popular in your country?**

Not really. Our people seem to be more entertainment-oriented and education is not a priority here, honestly. I wish this would change and we’d see more public libraries with 24/7 service and other modern-day features.
