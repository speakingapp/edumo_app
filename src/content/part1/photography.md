**Do you like taking photos?**

As an artistically inclined person, I can say that photography is a contemporary form of art and I like to express myself in this discipline quite often. No matter whenever and wherever I am, I have my camera ready for another snapshot which can turn into yet another great shot. It’s all about perfect timing in photography, I guess.

**How often do you take photographs?**

Again, I always have my camera steady just in case bump into something interesting worth shooting.

**Do you prefer to take photos of yourself or to have other people take your photos? Why?**

This actually depends on who those people are. I mean, if it’s a professional, then I fully trust him as a model because he knows his trade better than I do. However, being surrounded with average users, I prefer to take selfies as I know which angle and perspective works best for me.
