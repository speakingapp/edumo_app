**1.Do you have a best friend?**  
Yes, I do. His name is Dilmurod but I call him Dima for short. Dima is a year 5 medical student at Bukhara State Medical University.

**2.How often do you meet with your friends?**  
Now that we're all adults, we can not see each other as often as we used to. However, during winter and summer breaks, we have our traditional gathering and hang out together.

**3.What do you spend your time with them?**  
Oftentimes, we go to a cafe, have a bite and try to catch up with each others' lives and find out what we have been up to. Then we go for a little stroll around the town.
