**Would you buy T-shirts as souvenirs on vacation?**

I'll definitely hard pass that. They're usually overpriced and are not of the best quality for the sake of that. I'd rather get something more practical like a magnet for my fridge.

**Do you think older people who wear T-shirts are fashionable?**

It's hard to tell what kind of fashion statement is manifested by judging only one garment. I mean, if they're going for a de-aging look, T-shirts can definitely help with that on condition that it's properly matched with the rest of the look including colors, texture and the tone.

**Do you like T-shirts with pictures and prints?**

Not so strong as my liking for plain T-shirts, as they go along with pretty much anything. I can wear them with any type of trousers, tracksuits, shorts, and trainers for street and casual style as well as using them undershirts with a two-piece suit, for a smart casual look.

**Do you usually wear T-shirts?**

Yeah, I can say I'm a T-shirt man. I wear short sleeves and oversizes when it's warm or hot, however, in autumn and winter I use them as an undershirt with a two-piece suit or a jacket.

**Do you like wearing T-shirts?**

I'm always on the move, so I have to be in comfy clothes so that I'm fully involved in what I'm doing. T-shirts really help me out with this so I wear them at home, at the studio, for going out - basically, they're my go-every-time piece of wardrobe.
