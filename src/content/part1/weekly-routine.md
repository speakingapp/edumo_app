**How do you usually start your week?**

I am self-employed, so for me the start of the week is not something big or significant as I can delegate my workload and time as opposed to corporate workers who have fixed schedule.

**Can you describe one of your typical weeks?**

Again, I am my own boss, so there is nothing much to say about it. My weeks can vary depending on customer demand, workload and my own will to work, so in the end, I get to decide how much and how long I am gonna work.

**Do you often plan your weeks?**

I am a go with the flow type of man, so I deal with things as they come at me. However, I do some basic planning for some important meetings and deals, which I highly prioritize.
