1. **Where are you living now?**

I live in one bedroom apartment on the 3rd floor of the apartment block in the central neighborhood in my hometown. The accommodation here is considered one of the best in the entire city, so I am lucky on this.

- **What facilities are there in your area?**

It’s all included in there. 3 schools, 3 kindergartens, a supermarket and two drugstores – I can not think of anything else that one can be in need.

- **What do you like most about your area?**

It’s location and interior. I mean, Ive spent considerable amount on making my place super comfy and chill, and also it’s in good neighborhood.
