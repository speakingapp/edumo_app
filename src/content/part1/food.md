**What kinds of meals do you like?**

I like food rich in protein, carbohydrates and different vitamins and minerals as I work out regularly and my body needs bio fuel to grow new muscle mass and to maintain the existing one. I prefer, raw as well as boiled and steamed veggies and some beef and fish.

**Do you often have dinner with your family or friends?**

Not really. Since I live on my own, seldom do I catch up with my friends and family members over a meal. However, I like it this way as it makes each and every occasion special.

**When do you usually eat dinner?**

I try my best to stick to nutrition regime, so I usually have my dinner at around 7 p.m. The time is enough to digest the whole meal before going to sleep.
