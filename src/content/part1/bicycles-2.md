**Do you like riding a bicycle?**

I love cycling! Ever since I sat down to the seat at the age of 7, I have been doing nothing but getting a deep sense of pleasure whenever I go out for a ride.

**How often do you ride it?**

I used to have a bike but now I donâ€™t. Luckily, we have a bike rental at the park, so I can go riding when I have some free time and when I feel like to.

**When do you think is the best time to ride a bicycle?**

It seems to me morning is the best time for a ride, at least from my perspective. It can be a good workout for an upcoming day and charges you with positive vibes throughout the day.
