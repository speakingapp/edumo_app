**What's your favorite wild animal?**

The name is the honey badger. They are notoriously well-known for their nasty and tough character as well as their natural defense features in the animal kingdom, allowing them to stand up against such ultimate predators as lions and still get away with it. The thing is other animals wouldn’t want to mess with such a menace, so honey badgers are real badasses in the wildlife.

**Are there wild animals in your country?**

Uzbekistan is a mixture of different terrains and landscapes, so the fauna varies depending on the natural habitat. Wolfs, foxes, deer, birds of prey, and other animals are verified to be native to Uzbek wildlife.

**Have you ever seen wild animals?**

I have only seen them at the zoo, where it’s safe to watch and observe them. I’ll think twice before encountering any specimen in the wild because they’re fully driven by their instincts and thus totally unpredictable and I don’t want any complications regarding that.

**Where can we see wild animals?**

There are tons of youtube videos about wild animals as well as documentary films available on the web. Also, animals can be observed at the zoo, despite being in captivity. For nature admirers, there are some options such as safari and guided tours into the wild to see animals in their natural state.

**Do you like watching animals in the zoo?**

Yes, I like that. They're used to being there, and they know humans are no threat, so they take it easy, unless not provoked, of course. It’s nice and fun watching them, in their enclosures, and the way they react to visitors, as some of them put on a show for people.
