**Do you usually jog in the morning?**

No, I don’t. My job requires frequent movements and pacing, so I get my moderate workout throughout the day at work.

**When was the last time you jogged?**

It was last year in April. Back then, I had a workout buddy who would keep up my enthusiasm and cheer me up. But then he suddenly disappeared and I haven’t done it since then.

**Where do you usually go jogging?**

There’s an artificial lake in Alisher Navoi park here in my hometown and it is the most popular destination for jogging and running, so I go there by default.
