1. **Do you like listening to music?**

As a music producer, I listen to music for several purposes and unlike general audience, who listens to music for pleasure, I also analyze, break down, assess and try some new genres out for myself.

- **When do you listen to music?**

Whenever I feel like to, honestly. I mean I don’t have certain fixed time on my schedule for listening to some bangers and hits. If I want to, I take my phone, plug in my headphones and launch the Spotify, where I listen to my tracks in a high quality. I just value the quality of the sound as a producer.

- **How much time do you spend listening to music every day?**

I am a little foggy about it, but I guess it’s something around half an hour of daily playtime. I can listen to the same tracks or decide to listen to some new releases and pick my favorites from them.
