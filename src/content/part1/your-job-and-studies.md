1. Can you describe your job or studies?

I am self-employed, meaning I work from home and complete my clientsâ€™ orders in a designated or agreed time. Then there is usually back and forth sending of the product, just to tweak it so that the client is happy about the service.

- Can you describe one of your typical days?

I wake up early at around 4 a.m. Then I have a breakfast and work for a while as I find myself the most productive at this time of the day. I take a short nap at around 9-10 a.m. until lunch. After having lunch, I do my routine around the home. I have a daily sessions at 4 p.m and as soon as I finish that, my working day is typically over. In the evenings, I can go out or enjoy myself at home. I hit the bed at around 10 p.m.

- What is your ideal job?

I think what I have now is ideal for me. I mean there is no pressure, or any boss or client yelling at me, I get to choose whether I wanna work with this client or not and how much I can work for a day, allowing me to fully organize my days and suit them perfectly to my needs.
