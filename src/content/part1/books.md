**1.Do you like reading books?**  
I am not much of a reader, but I like to read from time to time. Usually it's non-fiction and I am super picky about what I want to read.

**2.How often do you read?**  
Every once in a while, when I feel like to. Usually I do something else instead of reading.

**3.Do you have many books at home?**  
Oh yes, I have a huge collection of Russian and world literature. I haven't read all of them, but I know the main plot of each and every book.
