**1.Where was the last place you visited on holiday?**  
I think it was my last year trip to Bukhara. I'd never been there before, so it was a really nice experience for me.

**2.Would you like to go back there again?**  
Yes, of course. It was only a day trip and I would like to stay there for a while and explore it fully.

**3.What kind of tourist destinations do you usually prefer?**  
I would like to avoid tourist traps at all. The thing is I want to explore the city for the unseen point of view, which unfortunately is not the case with tourist destinations.
