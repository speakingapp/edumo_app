**1\. Where is your hometown?**

I come from a city called Navoi, which is the administrative centre of the Navoi region. The city was founded in 1958 and covers the area of 35 sq. km, however due to consistent construction boom the city is gradually expanding day by day.

**2\. What do you like about it?**

Initially, since I grew up here, I have a strong belonging to this place and people. On top of that, the crime rate is so low that I can walk out at night freely not worrying about anything. Last but not least, life expenses here are are reasonable, which attract a lot of people to settle here in Navoi.

**3\. Were there any changes in your hometown in recent years?**

Over the last two decades, my hometown has been through some serious changes. Initially, it has become more urbanized with a large number of high rise buildings introduced over the period. Also, it has expanded and still is being expanded due to construction boom. Lastly, the population has grown as there has been a flow of inner country migrants throughout the period.
