**1.Do you listen to music?**  
I am a part time music producer so I can say it's part of my job. I listen to analyze, to compose, to compare, to refer and to rate and react to different genres of music.

**2.Whatâ€™s your favorite kind of music?**  
it's hard to point out exactly one genre, however, I'm mostly into electronic dance music. It's a branch of music which is popular nowadays and contains dozens of different genres and sub-genres.

**3.What kinds of music are (most) popular in your country?**  
Folks here listen to uzbek pop as one can predict. There are some big names in the industry which constantly stamp generic stuff, but I am not a big fan of that, actually.
