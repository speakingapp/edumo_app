**Is a bag an ideal gift?**

Highly doubt it. It could be supposing it’s an LV, Gucci, Prada, or any other major brand bag. But then again, there’s no accounting for taste.

**Do you often change your bags?**

No. I usually pick up one, carry it around until it’s worn out, and then buy the substitute. For me, if I have one durable and comfy backpack, that’s enough for like until it gets expired.

**Do you like bags? What type of bags do you like?**

I’m really into backpacks and waist bags. Depending on the amount of stuff that I usually carry around, I usually end up between these two.

**Do you have different bags for different occasions?**

No. My rucksack is universal, and as a man, I don’t see any practical point in having multiple bags for different occasions. Besides I don’t go out that much, so there’s no real need either.

**Do you usually carry a bag when you go out?**

No, I usually prefer going out hands-free. Everything that I need including my phone and keys goes into my pockets, hopefully, they’re deep enough to store all of it.

**What do you put in your bag?**

Usually, these are my laptop, my journal, a pen or two, wet napkins just in case, a case of my glasses if I’m wearing a pair, my headphones, and a charger for my laptop and I’m good to go.

**When you are buying a bag, what factors do you consider?**

Not so many things actually. Firstly, whether it’s a brand stuff or not because despite the price brand bags do last for a long time, like my Vans backpack. Secondly, how many sections it has, here the more the merrier. Lastly, I check out if it is good to carry around and if it will be still good if fully loaded.
