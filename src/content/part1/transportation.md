**1.Do you prefer public transportation or private transportation?**  
I prefer private transport, as it's more convenient in terms of privacy. I mean, it's just me or my family and friends at maximum, whereas on public transport I get to take a ride with complete strangers, some of whom can have some shady intensions.

**2.Whatâ€™s the most popular means of transportation in your hometown?**  
This is definitely taxis. They are cheap, large in number and are available around the clock.

**3.How has public transportation changed in recent years?  
**More busses have been allocated for public transportation. Also, there are special wagons in underground specifically for women, so that they can travel safely.
