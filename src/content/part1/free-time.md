1. **What do you enjoy doing in your free time?**

Since I am in charge of my time fully, I have plenty of free time, however I just try to make sure that I don’t have any free time, so that I won’t be doing anything unproductive or time-wasting. The more free time you have, the more stupid you spend it, as it’s been proven.

- **How much time do you have each week for doing these things?**

Again, I try to make sure I don’t have free time at all. I am constantly grinding on my own.

- **Why do you like doing these activities?**

The reason why I don’t let myself chill even for a second is because I am young and strong and have a sharp mind, which I am using to guarantee myself a better future. I know for sure that I won’t be this good for a long time, so try to use all of the time in my command to make it in time.
