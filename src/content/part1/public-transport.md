1. **What kind of transport do you usually use?**

I use mostly taxis, as they are cheap and allow me more or less privacy. Also they get me wherever I want in a relatively affordable price.

- **How much time do you spend travelling on a normal day?**

As I work from home, I donâ€™t usually commute, however every other day I may go out to the city and then I can take a 15-20 minutes ride in a taxi.

- **What is the most popular means of transport in your country?**

These are private cars as our people do not quite understand and value the concept of public transportation.
