1. **Do you have a lot of furniture in your home?**

Well, I’d say quite moderate amount of furniture. I don’t like cramped spaces, rather my heart carves for more open space interiors. Plus, I’m a minimalist, so furniture for me is an extra fancy that I don’t really need.

- **Has anyone bought a piece of furniture for you?**

I tried selling my old set of furniture, however I didn’t succeed. The good thing is it’s now in my cottage standing outside as a cool spot for siesta.

- **What kind of furniture would you like to buy?**

I am into minimalism, so I like appreciate multi-functional stuff which doesn’t attract much attention. Something simple, practical, and down to earth will do me just as fine.
