**1\. Do you like painting/ drawing? Why?**

Yes, I do. I used to be fancy of drawing when I was in primary school. I just enjoyed copying the figure in my drawing book and making use of any color as I like. I felt proud of being praised by my relatives when they saw my drawing pasted on the wall of my house.

**2\. Do you think children should learn drawing?**

It depends. If a child has interest in drawing, it's OK for him to do. Parents should encourage their children to do what they like. However, it's useless to push every child to learn drawing.

**3\. Why do primary schools have painting class?**

It's said it's a great time for children at primary schools to do painting for plenty of advantages. Children can express what they think of the world through drawing, and many enjoy the various colors. Besides children will think for the figure they'd like to draw, the tool they need to complete their painting. Children will be more creative in the process of doing painting.

**4\. Why do people display art work (painting) at their homes?**

Most people do that because of their love of art work. For example, people in love ofphotographing, though they are amateur, and they prefer to hang the pictures they took at home.Also, there are people enjoying art work as a kind of decoration, and they like to appreciateworks of others. For instance, many wealthy people like to collect and display famous art work.

**5\. Have you ever bought any painting?**

Yes, I have. The only painting I bought was the one sold at the charity activity held in my secondary school. Each year, a fete will be organised when students donate something to sell to others, and the money will be collected to help students from poor families. The painting was a copy of the famous painting "Playing Shrimps" by a new student, whom I made friends with later.

**6\. Do you think painting (or drawing) is important for adults?**

Yes, I do. Adults can draw or paint what they like in their spare time. It is a hobby that won't disturb others, and you can enjoy it very much if you can explore it deeply.

**7\. Do you still draw those pictures that you did in your childhood?**

Not really. I don't draw the sun, flowers, and trees as I did in my childhood. Now I draw those elements in a different way, in a more abstract way.
