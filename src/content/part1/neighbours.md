1. **Do you know all your neighbours?**

Not really. I mean, I know my next door neighbor, I don’t know all of them. I believe it’s an extra information that I don’t really need and I do not want to intervene to people’s lives, nor do I want others to do so to me.

**2\. How often do you talk to your neighbours?**

On a daily basis. Nothing specific, just exchanging some pleasantries.

- **How well do you get along with your neighbours?**

I’m in good contact with my next door neighbor, our families maintain friendship. However, I don’t go beyond small talk with other neighbors.
