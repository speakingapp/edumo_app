**Do you like watching movies?**

Actually, one of my favorite hobbies is watching movies. It doesn’t really matter whether I am watching one for the first time or re-watching it again, what I like about is that I love the camera work, actors play and as well as sound design and track selection.

**What kind of movies do you like?**

I used to like horrors when I was a teenager, but now I am interested in psychological thrillers, which run shivers down my spine although there is nothing much going on the screen compared to the horrors.

**What is your favorite movie?**

My favorite movie is a 2002 Sony Picture’s Spiderman starring Tobey Maguire. The plot goes around an average teenager Peter Parker, living with his uncle and aunt. One day, he gets bitten by an experimental spider at the lab where peter’s class take a day trip to, and since then he leads a double life. The movie portrays all the changes, struggles and battles of a daytime high school student and a night time superhero.
