**1\. Who does cooking at your home? Why?**

My grandma does cooking at my home. I was left to be under care of my grandma since my parents went to city to make a living while I was live years old. My grandma cooks all yeararound except on holidays when my mother is at home in charge of housework.

**2\. What do you think of cooking program in China?**

There are kinds of popular cooking programs nowadays, and they are shown mostly in TV. I think the kind of program is meaningful. Chefs, or sometimes housewives, are invited to share their own way of cooking a dish in the program. Their experience is useful for learners who'd like to try cooking themselves.

**3\. When was the first time you did cooking? What you cooked?**  
The first I did cooking was on a summer day at my twenty. That day I made two dished with the help of my grandma. The first dish I made was â€œthe tomato fries the egg", my favourite food. Though I was a bit nervous, I did it right, however it's not as delicious as that cooked by grandma. Then I tried the 'pork braised in soy sauce', which I had much difficulty in getting the pork to be easy to chow. It's not bad as my first try.

**4\. What food did you like to eat when you were a child?**

I like to eat fast food such as KFC very much when I was a child. Although the media says fast food is not good for our health, as a child, I didn't care much about those things. As far as the food is delicious, I like to eat the food.

**5\. Do you think it's good to (often or sometimes) take children to restaurants?**

Yes, I think it is good to take children to restaurants sometimes. My parents would take me to restaurants since I was very a child, and I learned the table manners when eating outside.

**6\. Do you think it is important to cook at home? Why?**

Of course. There're at least three advantages for cooking at home. First, you can eat many delicious foods at a reasonable price. Second, food cooked at home is much safer than that in restaurants. Finally, it is very good to enjoy dishes together with family members.

**7\. What is the feature of the home-made food?**

The most important feature of home-made food is that food cooked at home is much safer than that in restaurants. And home-made food contains our love for family members, and this is hard to compare with foods made in restaurants by chefs.

**8\. What kind of food is popular in your country?**

Uzbekistan has a vast territory, so the popular food varies from place to place. Generally, there is some food that is very popular such as dumplings. According to places, the filling for dumplings is a bit different, but most people like to eat dumplings very much. At the Spring Festival, many families will also make dumplings themselves and share with friends and relatives.

**9\. Do people in different places like different kinds of food?**

It's natural that people in different places like different kinds of food. They grow up in different climate and environment. For example, people in Sichuan and Hunan province all like spicy foods, but there is a bit difference even between the two. People from the southeast tend to prefer sweet food.

**10\. Who usually does the cooking in your family (or, in your home)?**

My mom usually does the cooking at home. My father can't cook, so my mom takes the job to cook for the family. Sometimes I will also do some cooking if I want to try new dishes.

**11\. Did you learn how to cook when you were younger (or, when you were a child)?**

No, actually I didn't learn how to cook when I was a child. After I grew up, I gradually learned how to cook, and I find I like it very much. Cooking is a very interesting thing.

**11\. In the future, do you think you will be cooking more than you do now, or less? (Why?)**

Of course. Now I am a student, so I just cook for myself if I'm away from home. If I get married, I need to cook for my family members. Also, I need to make bento for my children, so I will be cooking more than I do now.

**12\. What kind of food do you think is healthy?**  
I think there is a lot of healthy food and how you cook it is the most important. Usually deep fried food or food that contains too much sugar or salt is considered bad for our health. We should eat a balanced diet and try to cook the food in a healthy way.

**13\. Do you think Uzbek people's diet is healthy?**

Yes, a lot of Uzbek people pay attention to the food we eat, and many of us like eating soup or vegetables. I think that's pretty healthy. But I have to admit that nowadays because of the fast pace of living, many people have to choose fast food for lunch, which is usually not healthy.

**14\. Will you change your diet habit?**

Yes, I'd like to make some changes. I actually eat too much junk food, which really makes me fat and unhealthy. In the future, I think I should learn how to cook by myself so that I could make healthy and delicious food at home. Also, I don't eat enough vegetables, so, in the future, I should try to have vegetables for every meal.

**15\. Do you like tasting new food?**

Yes, whenever I'm in a new place, I would always try my best to find the famous local food and have a taste. I think food cannot only satisfy my stomach but also can help us understand the local culture. However, sometimes, it's not easy to get used to the new food for the first we try it.

**16\. Do you like lunch or dinner?**

Probably dinner,because I usually have some fast food for lunch,which is not nutritious and doesn't always have a good taste. But our family usually can prepare the dinner together and we'll have several dishes and a soup for the meal. I love it not only because of the variety we could have, but also because of the family time we spend.
