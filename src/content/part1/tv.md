**1.Do you like watching TV?**  
I hate TV, and think that one of the worst ways to degrade is watching TV. even if I have a TV at home, I don't watch it at all.

**2.How often do you watch TV?**  
Again, I'm the least TV person one can imagine. It;'s just a complete waste of time.

**3.What kind of TV programs do you like to watch?**  
I used to watch documentaries on NatGeo about different animals, but now I watch them on the Internet, thanks to streaming apps.
