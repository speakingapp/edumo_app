**1.How important is the Internet to you?**  
Most of my job is on the Internet and my job requires network connection as well, so I would say, it is essential to me and my work.

**2.Do you use the Internet more for work or in your free time?**  
Sort of both, actually. I'm always connected to the net, so it does not really matter whether I am busy or not. I am just used to being online so that I can check anything if needed at anytime.

**3.Do you think you use the Internet too much?**  
Even though I am online 24/7, most of the time my devices don't do pretty much anything. I just like staying connected so that I won't waste time turning my data on or connecting to WiFi. So, I use it only when I have a necessity to do so.
