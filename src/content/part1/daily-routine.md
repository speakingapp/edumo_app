**1\. When do you usually get up in the morning?**

**Answer –** Well, I am a morning riser, and I usually get up at 6;30 am. Getting up early in the morning makes me feel fresh.

**2\. Do you usually have the same routine every day?**

**Answer –** Actually, I am a working person, and on weekdays my routine is the same but weekends make me a lazy person. So, I get up late in the morning.

**3\. What is your daily routine?**

**Answer –** Well, in the morning, I get up early to have a light breakfast and hit the gym about 7 am. After the one hour workout, I leave the gym and go to the supermarket to buy some fruits and vegetables. Then, I came back home and got ready for work at 10 am.

**4\. Do you ever change your routine?**

**Answer –** Yes, I underwent a change about two months ago because I had a tight schedule and was struggling to manage my targets.

**5\. Is your routine the same today as it was when you were a child?**

**Answer –** Actually, I can say that there’s a vast difference between my life then and my present life. You know, when I was a child, besides focusing on study, I had much free time to pursue my interests like watching television and listening to music. But now, my routine and time management has become strict.
