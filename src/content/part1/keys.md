**Have you ever locked yourself out?**

Once I was in a rush and left my keys in the drawer. While returning home, it clicked that I’d left them there, so I had to stay in a nearby café and binge-watch some videos on youtube until my sister came to the rescue.

**Do you think it's a good idea to leave your keys with a neighbor?**

Categorically depends on who is this neighbor and how well I know him/her. I mean I wouldn’t leave the keys to my flat where there’s so much that could be taken out to a stranger, but I would probably trust my next-door neighbor as I’ve known her for a decade and she’s okay with such things.

**Have you ever lost your keys?**

Not any instance that I know of. But I always put them somewhere while my thoughts are rushing, and then walk around the home like an idiot trying to find them.

**Do you always bring a lot of keys with you?**

I have only a couple of keys for each of the locks on my door with me and if I’m not having them with me, I’m not leaving anywhere.
