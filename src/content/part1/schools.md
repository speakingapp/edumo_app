**What changes would you like to see in your school?**

To my biggest surprise, my school hasn’t changed a bit since I left in 2015. It’s the same Soviet-type three-story building that desperately needs capital refurbishment and equipment because when I used to work there, I had a really hard time with network connection, which is a must-have for modern education establishments to my mind.

**Do you go to a good school?**

It was probably on top of the list which me and my parents could afford. Even though it was free and mandatory, there was one school and presidential schools which used to one-up the school where I studied.

**Did you go to a good school?**

I believe so. I mean I like it here and already made myself home, though it gets hot in here during controls and finals week. But I’m glad to be here, as I have so many friends and it’s also close to my home, so I see it as an absolute win.
