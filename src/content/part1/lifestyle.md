**1.What do you do in your free time?**  
I am self-employed, so I mostly decide how to delegate my free time on my own. I usually work on several projects and have some me time for self-care and other daily routine.

**2.Do you have a busy social life?**  
As an introverted persona, I wouldn't say I am very social but my job requires more or less social interaction but luckily I am used to that.

**3.Has your life changed much in the last year?**  
There's been a u turn in my life since last year. Now, i am at the moment in my life where I have always wanted to be so really enjoy what I'm doing now.
