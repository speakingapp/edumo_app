**Do you prefer rainy days or sunny days?**

As a person living in a sunny climate where there are 300 sunny days out of 365 possible, I guess I’m just used to sunny weather. However, I like it when it rains, or when it’s cloudy outside, it just cools down a bit and gives diversity to the weather.

**What do you do on rainy days?**

When it’s pouring outside, I stay indoors and try to find shelter as quickly as possible. Usually, I’d watch a movie, or do my work depending on how busy I am. If there’s nothing to do, I go and take a nap.

**Do you like wet weather?**

I like the weather after the rain, when there are still clouds in the sky and it’s cool, the weather is humid and it’s easy to breathe. There’s something unusual about mild weather which adds up to its aesthetics, making it more pleasant and appealing.

**Do you prefer wet or dry weather?**

I prefer dry only because I live in one and if it were wet, we’d have some serious trouble breathing here, as it would have been a real boiler room.

**Is there any part of your country where it doesn't rain much?**

Like, my hometown Navoi was founded in the desert terrain, so there’s little or no rainfall and humidity.

**What do you usually do when it starts to rain and you are outside?**

I try to look for a shelter, or hop in a car and get home as quickly as I can. If it’s a light rain, then I can walk freely without being worried to get wet.

**Do you think rain is good?**

In my culture rain is one of those times when all the prayers and supplications are accepted. In addition, rain is good for agriculture and farming as a part of the natural water cycle. Lastly, a lot of wild animals and plants depend on rain and wet weather and soil, so rain is vital not only in my culture but also for nature itself.

**How does rain affect life in your country?**

In spring, there’s a tendency for minor floods in regions prone to wet weather as it rains heavily there. Usually, these are areas close to mountains and hills, and there’s a possibility of all the crops being devastated as a result of flooding, causing scarcity for a particular culture during that period.

**Have you ever had to change your plans because of the rain?**

There was this one time when me and my friend wanted to set out for a ride but had to call it off because of the rain as it’s risky to drive then. We might fall asleep while being over the wheel and what's worse get into an accident so we made a safe choice and wait until it brightens up.
