1. **Do you like art?**

As an artistically inclined person, I can say yes. I love art in general, specifically I have a strong liking for music.

- **Do you think art classes are necessary? Why?**

I believe so. Art classes foster creativity and allows young minds to learn to express themselves via different art disciplines.

- **How often do you visit art galleries?**

It’s a pity we don’t have one in my hometown. However, there are virtual excursions for people like me and I enjoy them from time to time.
