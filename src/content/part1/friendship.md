**What will make you happy in the future?**

As I grew older, it came down to me that happiness is not about achieving or not achieving certain ambitions, but rather something that I have always had with me from the get-go, but failed to appreciate. It is those little things in life like a cup of a cappuccino or a late afternoon studio grind which make me content, and I hope I’ll have more chances to experience something similar in the future.

**When do you feel happy at work?**

I used to take pride in my students’ results, which would make me feel like a proud father with a shed of happiness tear in my eye. Now, I feel joyous when our team successfully accomplishes certain tasks and we get onto the next level.

**Do you feel happy when you buy new things?**

If the item is or has been on my wish list for a while or I’ve been really craving it. The feeling wears off as long as I get the hang of it, but when I use let’s say my new microphone, it always makes me remember that purchase experience.

**What made you happy when you were a child?**

Anything from watching cartoons late at night to taking a ride in an amusement park. All the sweets, toys, and playing out also falls into this category as well.
