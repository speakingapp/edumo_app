1. **Do you think you are a polite person?**

I am not the one to say this, but I try to keep the respectful conversation and some common sense while small talking to people. Out of pure courtesy, of course.

- **Who taught you to be polite?**

I donâ€™t know, like, I think it came naturally to me. People were really to me, and I think I thought that is the way I should treat people in turn. Still, I am glad it came out like this.

- **How do your family members show politeness?**

They call me cute names, greet me whenever they see me and just keep the friendly tone all the time.
