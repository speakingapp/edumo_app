**1\. How do you organize you time?**

I have a timetable in both my notebook and the cellphone to manage my time. At the beginning of every term I fill in the timetable firstly with the curriculum schedule. Then I can make proper plans of other activities according to the spare time I have.

**2\. Do you think young people organize their time in the same way?**

Most of my fellow students do it like me. Study is our prime task anyway, so we have to devote enough time to it. If there is much spare time left, we may consider joining in clubs or doing part-time jobs.

**3\. Are you ever late for anything?**

Yes, sometimes I sleep over in the morning and was late for the classes. Once I didn't manage to come back from part-time work to the class-meeting on time. But generally speaking I am a punctual person.

**4\. What excuses do you use when you late?**

Excuses will not help anything, according to me. So I told the truth rather than used excuses, and made apologies to the teachers and my classmates. They all forgave me in those cases.

**5\. (similar to above) What excuses do people have when are late?**

Well, some people don't like to use excuses when they are late. They just tell the truth and make apologies then. While some may make up lies or excuses, hoping not to be blamed by others. But the effect doesn't always turn out to be good.

**6\. Do you like it when others are late?**

Some people may mind it, but I don't really hate it when others are late. I think they must have their own reasons, or no one wants to be blamed for that.

**7\. In your country, do people forgive others when they are late?**

It depends on the exact circumstance. In a serious occasion such as a conference or an appointment, being late is annoying and may not be forgiven. But if it's a party among friends, I think people won't care if someone comes a little late.

**8\. If you had more time, what would you do with the extra time?**

I have been hoping to learn playing violin since I was 15 years old. But I have never had enough time to do it because I have to spend most of my time studying. So if I had more time I would use it to learn violin.
