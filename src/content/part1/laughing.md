1. **Do you often laugh?**

Yes, I try to stay positive as much as I can. Laughing serves as a free therapy, so why not?

- **Do you like to make people laugh?**

Yes, it’s magical when I can pull this off. Watching people being happy with what I do or say makes me elated for real.

- **Do you like watching comedies on TV?**

I don’t watch Tv, so I watch my comedies on streaming apps and online cinemas. Hopefully, there are tons of these and you can choose what you like for yourself.
