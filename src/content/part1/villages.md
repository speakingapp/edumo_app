**Do you like living in a village? Why?**

I think I could enjoy some time there as a time-off from the city life, however I am quite used to urban lifestyle which is in sync with my personality.

**What are some of the advantages of living in a village?**

Clearly, living in the countryside has some merits. Initially, itâ€™s more peaceful, compared to hustling and bustling cities, where there is a lot of noise during the day and night. In addition, the crime rate is extremely low or does not even exist in the country. Last but not least, rural people have an advantageous access to organic food, which they produce themselves.

**Is there anything you don't like about living in a village?**

Sure. I mean I quite fancy the perspective of living in the countryside, however the infrastructure is not sufficiently developed there, so I am afraid I can get bored easily there without any entertainment and nightlife. However, it sounds like a decent option for later period of my life, when I am going to need peace and privacy.
