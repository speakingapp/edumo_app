1. **Do you like outdoor activities?**

Not that I am an active person, however I do realize that I need them. I am still into strolling around the town with my friend, it’s very mind-refreshing.

- **What kind of outdoor activities do you do?**

As I mentioned just now, I am into taking a walk around the city with a friend of mine. It’s nothing much, I at least, I get to enjoy the views and take some moderate workload on my skeletal musculoskeletal apparatus.

- **How often do you do outdoor activities?**

At least once a week. Still, it depends on factors like my mood and to what extent I am busy and weather conditions.
