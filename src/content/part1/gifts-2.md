1. **Do you like receiving gifts?**

Who doesn’t! I get flattered when someone presents a gift to me. It shouldn’t be something big or material – a little thing can make my day and make it to my heart as a long-lasting sweet memory I’m ready to reminisce over and over.

- **What kind of gifts do you like receiving?**

I don’t like big stuff. Could be a bar of chocolate, a watch, a nice pair of headphones, basically whatever. It’s not about the stuff, it’s about the sheer attention and care to me.

- **What gifts did you receive in your childhood?**

Well, I was that spoiled kid. I had a lot of toys, most of which obviously were cars. However, when I grew up I picked up a taste for books as gifts and when asked, I used to and still say to people to get me a nice book.
