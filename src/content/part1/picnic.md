**1\. Do you like going to picnics?**

Absolutely, I love them! However, due to my consistently busy work schedule, rarely do I get such a chance to enjoy myself.

**2\. When was the last time you went to picnic?**

It was last year in summer. Me and my friends went to our local lake and chose a pretty peaceful place with a lot of greenery for a picnic. We had some snacks; the music was playing throughout the picnic and we had a time of our lifetime.

**3\. How do you enjoy a picnic?**

Usually I like unwinding and escaping from the hustle and bustle of the city, specifically the noise. Being surrounded with nature sounds only, my ears get to relax and it is definitely sounds like a music to my ears!
