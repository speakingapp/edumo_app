1. **How do you usually spend your weekends?**

I just chill doing pretty much nothing, since I can allow myself to do that. I watch movies, scroll on my media or could work for a little bit.

- **What is your favourite part of the weekend?**

It’s probably Saturday nights, when I know that I have a free day, so I give myself some freedom of actions and can let my guard down for a while.

- **Did you do anything special last weekend?**

Honestly, I can’t remember. On the second thought, however, I remember it was the toughest one in my recent memory. I just upgraded my living room with super soft carpet and some new furniture.
