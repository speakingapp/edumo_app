**1.What’s your favourite kind of weather?**

My favourite weather is when it's between +15 and +20 degrees, sunny, with little or no clouds in the sky. In this weather, I can usually wear my favourite pieces of my wardrobe so I like really enjoy it.

**2.Is there any type of weather you really don’t like?**

I don't like wet weather, especially when it's gloomy and raining heavily. I guess I dislike it because I am so used to the weather in my hometown.

**3.What is the climate like in your country?**

In Uzbekistan, the climate is severe continental, meaning we have all 4 seasons with cold winters and hot summers. On average there are 300 sunny days out of 365, with little or no rain at all depending on regional differences.
