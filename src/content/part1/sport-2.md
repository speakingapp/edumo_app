**1\. What is your favorite sport?**

My grandad was a strong chess player, so I inherited some of his passion and skills towards chess. I love chess because it is all about the strength and flexibility of the minds of players playing against each other.

**2\. What kind of sports did you play as a child?**

In my childhood, unlike now, I had a particular liking for active sports, such as football. However, as I grew older, I lost my interest towards football as I had taken up English by that time.

**3\. Do you prefer team sports or individual sports?**

I am not a really good team player, and plus chess, which is my all-time favorite, is an individual sport, so I guess team sports are out of the question here.
