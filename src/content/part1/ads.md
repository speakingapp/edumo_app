**1.Do you like watching advertisements?**  
Depends on the ad. If it's well-made and catchy then I'd give it a shot.

**2.Will you buy something because of an advertisement?**  
It could trigger me to an extent, but I won't buy anything just because I saw it on the ads.

**3.Do you like funny or serious advertisements?**  
Again, it depends on the quality. I do not care about the overall mood of the ad, the first thing I pay attention to is production quality and style.
