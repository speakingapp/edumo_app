**1.What kind of movies do you like?**  
I love psychological thrillers that run shivers down my spine. They are not so vulgar and cliche as horrors, but there is something really gut-wrenching about them.

**2.Do you usually watch films alone or with others?**  
I like to watch my films alone. By doing so, I am sure I pay attention to every minute detail, every special effect and sound effect that is used in the movie.

**3.Which actor would you like to play you in a film?**  
I think it's Rami Malek, as he can portray pretty much all personality types.
