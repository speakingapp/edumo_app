**Do you work or are you a student?**  
I'm a student. Now, Tm studying in XX University in XX province and my major is XX, which requires us to do a lot of relative practice. I'm about to graduate next year, but I want to pursue my master's degree in XX.

I'm a high school student in XX high school. I'll graduate next year and I'm planning to study in the UK because I think the education system there is very advanced. I hope I can get into a good university so that I can be competitive in the job market when I graduate. I'm working. I have been working in a private company in my hometown for two years. I think the job is very suitable for me because I could use what I have learned at school and of course there're also a lot of new things for me to learn in this field.

**1) Your Work**

**What job (or, what work) do you do? What do you do in that job?**

I'm an accountant in a private company in Hangzhou. My job involves a lot of calculating and tabulating. Sometimes, it's hard to explain what I do because I don't produce or sell products, but I think my job is important for the company.

**Why did you choose to do that kind of work(or, that job)?**

I chose to be an accountant because I majored in accounting when as was in the college. And I had already accumulated some work experience by doing part-time jobs before I graduated. What's more, the job suits my character and my interest.

**Would you recommend the job to other people?**

Yes, I recommend it to people who are majored in Business or Accounting. They may be able to put the knowledge they have learned in the courses into practice. And it is a well-paid job.

**2) Your Studies**

**Do you like your major?**

Yes, I do. I actually chose my major by myself because I'm interested in science since middle school. When I was a child, I always wanted to be a scientist. Now, I feel I'm closer and closer to my dream.

**Is that a popular major in your country?**

Yes, it is. It's comparatively easier for engineering major students to find suitable jobs because there are a lot of manufacturers in China and they all need professional engineers to work in the R&D department or their factories. I guess the prospect of this major is bright.

**Is it difficult to learn your major?**

Kind of. My major involves a lot of math and physics theories, so if one wants to be excellent in this field, you must know the foundational knowledge well. Sometimes, we alsoneed to do some lab work and I think the most difficult part is put what we have learned into practice.

**Do you think it's important to choose a subject you are interested in? (Why?)**

Definitely. It's probably true for everybody. When you're interested in something, you can put more effort into it and you're more likely to succeed. However, if you have no interest in something, you probably can do it, but it's hard to be good at it. So, teachers should try their best to arouse students' interest and help them to learn unconsciously and students should choose something their interest lies in.

**What's the most enjoyable part of being a student?**

It's hard to say. As a student, I can learn knowledge and don't need to work to earn my living. However, sometimes, I feel it's hard to be a student because I have too much workload and so many things to learn.

**For you, what's the most interesting part (or subject or class) of your course?**

I like practical knowledge. When I learn something about my future work, I would always feel excited. I feel I'm not only learning some theories, but the real skills for my career. It's the most interesting part for me.

**(For high school) What's the most interesting of your subjects at school?**

I love science. I think science classes can help me know the wonders of the universe and tell me the laws of the nature. Because of my science classes, many questions I have had since I was a child have been solved.

**What are your future work plans? (after you graduate)**

Now, I'm planning to pursue my master's degree in the UK. After my graduation, I would find a job at one of the world's best enterprises because there will be more promotion opportunities in such companies. I don't mind starting from a lower position, but eventually I want to become a department manager.

**Who do you think is more important, the students or the teacher?**

I think both. The classmates can create a group atmosphere, which could be warm, hostile, or indifferent. If you have a bunch of good classmates, you could get help from them in your studies or social life. Teachers are also important. They could teach professional and moral knowledge. If the teachers are dedicated, they could influence the students learning outcomes and world view.

**Are there anything special about your teachers and classmates in this major?**

Yes. Professors and students studying science tend to be a little nerdy. We don't mind spending a lot of time reading or doing experiments. It's probably true that many of my classmates are not very sociable; however, there're always exceptions.

**How should teachers teach?**

Teachers shouldn't only teach, they should help students learn well and arouse their interests. Since we will leave school sooner or later and there's still a lot there for us to learn, teachers should foster students' self-teaching abilities so that they will become lifelong learners.

**Will children tell their parents when they face difficulties in their studies?**

It depends on the children's personalities. A lot of children like sharing what happen at school, things both good and bad. It's always good to get help from  
their parents. However, some children feel it's embarrassing to tell their parents their bad grades at school, which might make them want to hide the truth from their parents.

**Do you think it's good for teachers to praise the students when they do something good and point it out when they do something wrong?**

Of course. When children get approval from their teachers, they'll be motivated to do better in the future. When they do something wrong, they also need someone to remind them. However, it's not good to give complements all the time and too much criticism can also create hatred and make students rebellious.

**What subject(s) are you studying?**

I am studying Business. There are many specialized courses related to it, such as Introduction to Business Conference, Marketing Strategy and Business Law &Company Law. I have to study the general courses for all college students as well.

**Why do you choose to study that?**

I chose to study Business because I dreamed to be a businessman since I was a kid. You know, both my parents are businessmen and I have been greatly influenced by them. I am determined to learn the courses well before I can really set about to practice.

**What school/university do you go to now?**

I go to Zhejiang University, one of the best universities in China. Many great scientists and artists, such as Feng Zikai and Zhu Kezhen graduated from this university. The Business College is in the campus located on Xixi Road, in the West of Hangzhou.

**How long have you been going to that school/studying your subjects?**

I've been studying here/this subject for 3 years. Being a junior, I have finished all the required general courses and most of my major courses. That's why I am preparing for the IELTS test and the further education.

**Do you like studying at that school/university?**

Yes, I enjoy studying there very much. With a river flowing nearby, the environment of the campus is quite good. Convenient facilities are available in teaching buildings, the library and mass-media rooms all day along. And teachers help a lot both in the class and in our daily life.

**What's the most important thing/part of your study life?**

It's hard to say. As a student, I think I should firstly learn the courses well. However, a lot of my classmates and I are doing part-time jobs in our spare time in order to accumulate some work experience and to social experience. I think both of them are also essential when we are to find jobs.
