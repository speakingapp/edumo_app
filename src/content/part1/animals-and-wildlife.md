1. **Do you like wild animals?**

Yes. I would not probably like encountering with them, but I like to watch them from safe distance.

- **What is your favourite wild animal? Why?**

It’s honey badger. This animal does not know or does not have the word fear in its vocabulary. It’s really nasty, eager and no one likes it in animal kingdom to a degree that even lions do not mess with them.

- **Have you ever seen animals in the wild?**

No, my hometown is founded in a desert, so the wildest what ive seen so far is a pack of stray dogs in my neighborhood.
