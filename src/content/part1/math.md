**Do you like math?**

I hate maths, because at school I was not particularly good at, in fact gifted at all at maths, and I used to struggle a lot with it. I still do not understand how those formulas and theorems can be applied to daily life.

**When did you start learning mathematics?**

It’s a common practice in my country to teach kindergarten kids some basic arithmetics, like adding and subtracting, so I guess it was kindergarten where I learned my first maths.

**How do math skills help us in daily life?**

I’m actually quite in the dark about it, because except for elementary arithmetic operations, I hardly see any practical use for maths. I guess that is why they do not have a Nobel’s prize for maths as it is completely theoretical.
