**1.Do you use computers?**  
I have an HP laptop and I just love it. Can't imagine how I could live without it.

**2.What do you use a computer to do?**  
I use it to scroll on social media, to work on Microsoft Office apps, do some audio and video editing, check my emails. Nothing extraordinary honestly.

**3.Do you think computers changed your life a lot?**  
Yeah, I mean I have gigabytes of personal data on my hardware not to mention, I use to access my pages on social media. They are sort of my technical extension, so to speak.
