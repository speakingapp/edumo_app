1. **When do you usually go to bed?**

I go to bed at 10 p.m and try to make sure I follow this routine everyday. I value my sleep because it helps me to be creative, mindful, calm and productive the next day.

- **How often do you go to bed late?**

Frequently, but I wish I didn’t stay up at night at all. No matter what you’re up to, it’s not worth sacrificing your night’s sleep, so I think.

- **What do you normally do when you stay up late?**

I binge watch YT, scroll on my socials, listen to music or talk with my girlfriend on a video call.
