**1\. Do people read more nowadays?**  
I think that’s tough to say, but all in all I would guess that people today read less than people in the past did. Take someone like my mom for example. In the past, she was a very avid reader, and would finish at least a few books every week. These days, she still reads occasionally, but with all of the great TV shows available to stream instantly, she actually spends a lot more time watching TV. So, I think people today read less because of the wide availability of other sources of entertainment, like TV

**2\. Let’s move on to the topic of traditional literature in your country. What is one example of traditional literature in your country?**  
Well, there are many kinds of traditional literature that were originally written in several different languages. One famous example I can think of is an epic poem which was written over two thousand years ago called the Ramayana. The poem was written in Sanskrit, and it describes the life of a god named Rama. Do you like reading the traditional literature of your country?

**3\. Do you like reading the traditional literature of your country?**  
Yes, I love it. Reading traditional literature brings me closer to the country that I live in and it is very enjoyable. Because, when you read literature from a particular country, you get to know more about its culture and it is truly my dream to explore my country and understand it more deeply.
