**1\. Do you think change is good?**  
Yes, and my hometown developed significantly in the last twenty years.It became industrialized, which I think is beneficial to us residents and to our local economy since jobs have been generated.However it is the saddest thing about its development is that it brings so much pollution.I think we are paying the price for converting our agricultural lands to industrial ones.

**2\. Why do old people not accept change?**  
Nowadays, it’s probably not a question of age, it depends more on the individual person. Older people are still very adaptable and although they might not be interested in some of the things that younger are crazy about or use, they still have the ability to adopt new ideas and ways of doing things. My father, for example, grew up without the internet but through his work and because he’s interested in what technology can achieve he probably knows more about it than I do and is therefore always ready to try the next new thing – which interest him – not necessarily me. Being adaptable is very much a personal trait, not so much age related. I even know some young people who don’t like change much.

**3\. In what ways have changes in technology changed people's lives?**  
Technology pretty much has changed each and every aspect of our lives, but perhaps it is safe to say that it has changed the way we communicate with each other the most with the advent of the internet, mobile phones and smart gadgets. Technology has indeed proved the age-old saying “talk is cheap”- so cheap that we talk to each other by using our phones pretty much always, whether we are staying close to each other or far apart, even when we don’t need it. We have also become lazy to walk even 100 feet or a few minutes these days if we are in need to communicate something to our friends or families since we can do the same in seconds just by pushing a button on our phones. But, if we are not in a mood or feel really lazy to “talk” sometimes, we simply leave or send a message on social media networks and “messenger” to inform others about our “status”. Finally, technology has made communication really “personal” as we can see each other on live video while communicating, no matter where we live with the use of the internet.
