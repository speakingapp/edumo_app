**1\. Where do people like to live in your country?**  
Well, although residential choices obviously vary with personal preferences, I would say, from my observation, that urban dwellers make up the majority of my country’s population. And I think that’s because of the rich variety of job opportunities there.

**2\. Why do many people move to the city?**  
As mentioned previously, career chances is the uppermost reason, without a doubt. Aside from that, the availability and quality of education and healthcare services are other key factors. Also, those who want amenities within reach wouldn’t even give a second thought, I believe.

**3\. What are the advantages of living close to the workplace?**  
Well, the benefits are substantial. First of all, it significantly saves workers’ commuting time and expenditures on fuel. And as a result, the money and time saved could be allocated to their other concerns. Second, in many urgent cases when people need to show up quick at their company, it wouldn’t be an issue.

**4\. What kind of place do older people prefer to live in?**  
Well, again, it’s a matter of personal preferences, I think. If they want to live close to their young who usually settle in the city, they will probably opt for the place. On the other hand, the tranquil surroundings and the slow-paced lifestyle of the countryside would be more agreeable to those who have slowed down in their senior years. Furthermore, community ties are often higher there, so it’s easier for the elderly to receive emotional and social support from people around.
